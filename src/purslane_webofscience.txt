Therefore the evaluation of potential species that could be used for that purpose is of major importance. Common purslane is such a species due to its high nutritional value, since it is considered the richest plant source in omega-3 fatty acids (especially alpha-linolenic acid).  Scope and approach: In this review all the aspects related with chemical composition and health effects of common purslane are presented. Additionally, an overview of cultivation practices and breeding prospects and their effect on quality are also presented. Special interest is given on bioactive compounds such as alpha-linolenic acid and oxalic acid due to their important effects on human health.  Key findings and conclusions: Purslane has been used in human diet throughout the centuries, however there are health concerns regarding its oxalic acid content that limit the recommendation of its regular use in human diet. Cultivation practices and breeding selection have been confirmed to allow for managing the content of the main bioactive compounds and consequently increase the added value of the final product. However, further studies are need in order to incorporate purslane in food industry, either as raw, minimally processed and processed food product, or as an ingredient in food and dietary supplements and drugs. In conclusion, the high nutritional and therapeutic value of common purslane should be further capitalized, whereas the application of proper cultivation practices could contribute to this purpose by improving quality.

The NiPc compound, when excited at 350 nm, decreases of emission with increases of the iron(III) concentration at 425 nm were used analytical response in a modified standard addition method. The method was validated by analyzing two certified reference materials (CRM-SA-C Sandy Soil C and Mixed Polish Herbs (INCT-MPH-2). Food and drug samples were digested in a closed microwave system using nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, all iron in the samples converted to iron(III) ion. These solutions were used directly in determination of iron(III) ion. No cleanup or enrichment of the solutions was required. The calibration graph was linear until 14.00 mu g mL(-1). Detection limit and quantification limit were 1.29 mu g mL(-1) and 3.88 mu g mL(-1), respectively. The method provided accurate results for the majority of the food samples tested, including spanich, dill, mint, purslane, rocket, red lentils, dry beans and two iron medicinal tablets. Also, the high recovery (95.6 %) was obtained for a fortified stream water sample. The simple and cost-effective method is suitable for monitoring total iron concentration in foods and drug samples.

The establishment treatments (EST) consisted of two seedlings each of common purslane, large crabgrass, and yellow nutsedge transplanted at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 12 wk after tomato transplanting (WAT) and remained until tomato harvest to simulate weeds emerging at different times. The removal treatments (REM) consisted of the same weeds transplanted on the day of tomato transplanting and removed at 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 12 WAT to simulate weeds controlled at different times. The beginning and end of the CPWC, based on a 5% yield loss of marketable tomato, was determined by fitting log-logistic and Gompertz models to the relative yield data representing REM and EST, respectively. In both grafted and nongrafted tomato, plant aboveground dry biomass increased as establishment of weeds was delayed and tomato plant biomass decreased when removal of weeds was delayed. For a given time of weed removal and establishment, grafted tomato plants produced higher biomass than nongrafted. The delay in establishment and removal of weeds resulted in weed biomass decrease and increase of the same magnitude, respectively, regardless of transplant type. The predicted CPWC was from 2.2 to 4.5 WAT in grafted tomato and from 3.3 to 5.8 WAT in nongrafted tomato. The length (2.3 or 2.5 wk) of the CPWC in fresh market tomato was not affected by grafting; however, the CPWC management began and ended 1 wk earlier in grafted tomato than in nongrafted tomato.

Portulaca oleraceae (purslane), a member of the Portulacaceae family, is widespread as a weed and has been ranked the eighth most common plant in the world. In this study, we sought for potential beneficial effects of Portulaca oleracea ethanolic extract (POEE) against the neurotoxicity induced by MeHg in cerebellum and cortex of rats. Male Wistar rats were administered with MeHg orally at a dose of 5 mg/kg b.w. for 21 days. Experimental rats were given MeHg and also administered with POEE (4 mg/kg, orally) 1 h prior to the administration of MeHg for 21 days. After MeHg exposure, we determine the mercury concentration by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS); mercury content was observed high in MeHg-induced group. POEE reduced the mercury content. We also observed that the activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and the level of glutathione were reduced. The levels of glutathione reductase and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance were found to be increased. The above biochemical changes were found to be reversed with POEE. Behavioral changes like decrease tail flick response, longer immobility time, and decreased motor activity were noted down during MeHg exposure. POEE pretreatment offered protection from these behavioral changes. MeHg intoxication also caused histopathological changes in cerebellum and cortex, which was found to be normalized by treatment with POEE. The present results indicate that POEE has protective effect against MeHg-induced neurotoxicity.

A two years field experiment was performed to estimate interference of T. portulacastrum and C. rotundus and to evaluate the role of allelopathic water extracts for effective weed management in maize. Five plant water extracts in ten binary combinations were foliar applied in triplicated randomized complete block design. Plots treated with commercial herbicide atrazine and weedy check (control), were also maintained for comparison. The highest density of both weed species was observed at 45 days after sowing (DAS) while weed dry biomass was higher at 60 DAS. Binary combination of sorghum-sunflower depicted greater suppression for weed density, dry biomass and persistence index (88-92% for T. portulacastrum and 65-81% for C. rotundus) as compared with weedy check. This treatment combination has also recorded an enhancement of 125% in crop resistance index, 84% in leaf area index and 41% in crop growth rate at 60-75 DAS thus, leading to 51% improvement in grain yield. Binary combination of sunflower-brassica returned maximum marginal net benefit, while sorghum-maize combination anticipated the peak value for marginal rate of return. Along with the effective weed management and higher yield, sorghum-sunflower documented the maximum net economic benefits among different plant extract combinations therefore, suggesting that exogenous application of sorghum-sunflower extract can be effectively used for controlling these weeds in maize field.

Although antioxidant and antidiabetic effects of the aqueous extract of purslane (Portulaca oleracea) (AEOP) have been demonstrated before by other researchers, we did not find any study that assessed the psychobiological effects of AEOP in diabetes induced animals. Thirty ovariectomized (OVX) female Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups of control, Dia and Dia+AEOP. The latter group was orally treated by 300 mg/kg of AEOP for 35 days. Dia and Dia+AEOP groups were made diabetic by IP injection of 60 mg/kg of streptozotocin (STZ). The psychobiological effects of AEOP were assessed by Morris water maze (MWM), elevated plus maze (EPM), forced swimming test (FST) and tail pinch stressor (TPS). AEOP significantly decreased hyperglycemia (p<0.001). Diabetes significantly decreased their spatial cognitive performance at the training trial as well as the total distance traveled at the probe trial in MWM (p<0.05). All the diabetes related deficits at training trials were improved by AEOP treatment (p<0.05). AEOP treatment not only improved the motor deficit of Dia group in EPM, but also showed anxiolytic effects compared to both control and Dia groups (p<0.05). In the FST, no differences were observed between any groups (p>0.05). Diabetes significantly increased their non-functional masticatory activity in TPS (p=0.001) while it was improved in Dia+AEOP group. We showed that AEOP has significant anxiolytic effects and it can improve spatial cognitive performance, locomotor deficit and stress in diabetic OVX rats.

D-galactose (D-gal) generates free radicals and accelerates aging. Portulaca oleracea (Purslane) may have protective effect against oxidative stress.  Objective: Purslane ethanolic extract effects were evaluated on antioxidant indices and sex hormone in D-gal aging female mice.  Materials and Methods: 48 female NMRI mice (25-35 gr) were randomly divided into, 6 groups: 1-control (normal saline for 45 days), 2-Purslane (200 mg/kg for last 3 weeks), 3-D-gal (500 mg/kg for 45 days), 4-D-gal+Purslane, 5-Aging, 6-Aging+Purslane. Sex hormones, antioxidants and malondialdehyde (MDA) level of ovary and uterus were measured. Histological assessment was also done.  Results: In D-gal treated and aging animals, LH and FSH levels were significantly increased (p < 0.001) while estrogen and progesterone levels were significantly reduced (p < 0.001) in comparison with control group. MDA contents were significantly increased in ovaries and uterus of D-gal and aging groups (p < 0.01). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) (p < 0.001) and catalase (p < 0.01) activities were significantly decreased in both aging and D-gal treated animals. Ovarian follicles were degenerated and atrophy on uterine wall and endometrial glands was observed in D-gal and aging groups. Alteration in hormone levels, MDA contents and antioxidant activity were significantly reversed by Purslane (p < 0.05). Purslane could also improve histological changes such as atrophy of endometrium.  Conclusion: These findings indicate that Purslane can attenuate aging alternations induced by D-gal and aging in female reproductive system.

A 2-year field study was conducted to evaluate the influence of different crop residues on weeds dynamics and productivity of maize under semi-arid conditions. Chaffed herbage (2-3 cm) of four crops viz., sorghum, sunflower, rice, and maize was mixed in different combinations (each crop at a rate of 6 t ha(-1)) and was surface applied as mulch. A weedy check and s-metolachlor+atrazine application treatments were also established for comparison. Infestation of weeds had a negative impact on maize growth and yield. Nevertheless, surface applied mulches were helpful in suppressing weed pressure and improving maize growth and yield performance. Among different mulching combinations, the rice+sunflower+maize herbage recorded the maximum reductions in density and dry biomass of horse purslane and purple nutsedge compared with weedy check control. Total weeds suppression by this treatment was almost similar with s-metolachlor+atrazine application. A maximum increment in terms of crop growth rate, total dry matter accumulation and grain yield was observed due to the mulching of rice+sunflower+maize. All the mulching combinations significantly enhanced the quality of maize as compared with weedy check and the sorghum+sunflower+maize was more effective for maize quality. Taking together, the results depicted that crop residue mulches can effectively suppress weed growth along with enhancing growth, yield and quality of maize, suggesting that it can be successfully employed in organic weed management programs in maize.

Each treatment consisted of 4 replicate pens with 14 broiler chickens per pen. The results indicated that dietary inclusion of POP had no effect on broiler chickens body weight (BW) and body weight gain (BWG), whereas feed intake (FI) decreased compared to control (P < 0.05). Broiler chickens fed diets supplemented with 0.25, 0.75, and 1.00% of POP had a lower (P < 0.05) feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared to control at days 1125 and 1-43 of age. At day 43 of age liver superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx) activities were not affected by the treatments, whereas a greater (P < 0.05) liver catalase activity (CAT) was recorded in broiler chickens fed 0.25 or 0.75% POP. Erythrocyte GSH-Px activity was also greater (P < 0.05) when 0.50 and 1.00% of POP was added to the diet. Serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and serum and liver malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations were not affected by POP supplementation. Carcass characteristics, serum cholesterol, glucose, albumin, total protein, high density lipoproteins, and low density lipoproteins as well as haematocrit and haemoglobin values were not affected by POP treatments, whereas serum triglycerides increased (P < 0.05) in broiler chickens fed POP supplemented diets. Supplementation of diet with POP increased Lactobacillus population and decreased Escherichia coli population in the ileum (P < 0.05). In conclusion, POP improved feed efficiency and antioxidant status and can be considered as a feed additive in broiler chickens. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PE in improving glucose control, blood pressure, and lipid profile in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) treated with a single oral hypoglycemic agent at baseline. Subjects were randomized to treatment with three capsules of PE/day or a matched placebo. Change from baseline to the week 12 end-of-follow-up visit measures of glucose homeostasis, hemodynamics, and lipid profile was compared by treatment assignment. In addition, these measures were evaluated in a subgroup of responders, defined as patients whose week 12 HbA1c was lower than baseline values, regardless of treatment assignment. This group was further assessed in subgroups of baseline oral hypoglycemic treatment. A total of 63 participants were treated with either PE (n=31, 11 females, mean age 52.4 +/- 7.9 years) or matched placebo (n=32, 11 females, mean age 58.3 +/- 10.8 years). In the total cohort, systolic blood pressure declined significantly more in the PE group than the placebo group: -7.5 +/- 5.0 versus -0.01 +/- 0.3mmHg, P<.0001. In the responders' subgroup, HbA1c declined significantly more in the PE group than the placebo group: -0.8%+/- 0.4% versus -0.6%+/- 0.5%, P=.03. Few adverse events were reported. These were mild and did not differ by treatment assignment. PE appears to be a safe, adjunct treatment for T2DM, significantly reducing systolic blood pressure in the total cohort and HbA1c in the subgroup of responders.

The aim of this study was to obtain Si biofortificated leafy vegetables (tatsoi, mizuna, purslane, basil, Swiss chard, and chicory) to use for the fresh-cut products (ready to use). For the production of biofortified plants, a floating system with 0, 50 and 100 mg L-1 of Si in nutrient solution, was used. In addition, the assessment of bioaccessibility of biofortified plants, by in vitro gastro-digestion process, was performed.  RESULTS: The added silicon in nutrient solution did not influence yield and colour of vegetables but a species-related accumulation of Si (expressed as SiO2) was found: from 18 to 69 mg kg(-1) fresh weight (FW) in tatsoi, from 19 to 106 mg kg(-1) FW in mizuna, from 15 to 93 mg kg(-1) FW in purslane, from 41 to 294 mg kg(-1) FW in basil, from 17 to 76 mg kg(-1) FW in Swiss chard, and from 23 to 76 mg kg(-1) FW in chicory. The Si became bioaccessible in all species considered in a range from 23% (basil) to 64% (chicory).  CONCLUSION: The application of Si to the nutrient solution in the range of 50-100 mg L-1 allows biofortification of leafy vegetables. In addition, the biofortified vegetables showed, on average, more bioaccessible Si, with respect to unbiofortified vegetables.

The herbicidal activity assay in greenhouse tests showed several compounds (2g, 21, 2j, 2k, 21, 2m, 2n and 2o) exhibited significant herbicidal activity for controlling velvet leaf (Abutilon theophrasti medic.) and youth-and-old age (Zinnia elegans jacq.) at 37.5 g a.i./ha. In particular, 2h was found to be the most potential candidate herbicide and was proved higher activity than the lead compound 117. The result of the weed controlling spectrum test showed that 2h could effectively control dayflower (Commelina tuberosa), bur beggarticks (Bidens tripartita linn.), youth-and-old age, cassia tora (Cassiaobtusifolia L), velvet leaf, purslane (Portulaca oleracea) and false daisy (Eclipta prostrata L.). In addition, the mixture of compound 2h and propanil could produce a synergistic effect and enhance herbicidal activity. The result of the herbicidal activity assay in field test demonstrated that 2h could effectively control dayflower and nightshade (Disambiguation) with long-lasting persistence. The present work indicates that 2h may be a novel compound candidate as a potential herbicide. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Due to the lack of pharmaceuticals that specifically increase the uptake of glucose from the blood circuit, application of natural compounds might be an alternative strategy. However, the effects and mechanisms of action remain unknown for many of those substances. For this study we investigated extracts prepared from seven different plants, which have been reported to exhibit anti-diabetic effects, for their GLUT4 translocation inducing properties. Quantitation of GLUT4 translocation was determined by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy in insulin sensitive CHO-K1 cells and adipocytes. Two extracts prepared from purslane (Portulaca oleracea) and tindora (Coccinia grandis) were found to induce GLUT4 translocation, accompanied by an increase of intracellular glucose concentrations. Our results indicate that the PI3K pathway is mainly responsible for the respective translocation process. Atomic force microscopy was used to prove complete plasma membrane insertion. Furthermore, this approach suggested a compound mediated distribution of GLUT4 molecules in the plasma membrane similar to insulin stimulated conditions. Utilizing a fluorescent actin marker, TIRF measurements indicated an impact of purslane and tindora on actin remodeling as observed in insulin treated cells. Finally, in-ovo experiments suggested a significant reduction of blood glucose levels under tindora and purslane treated conditions in a living organism. In conclusion, this study confirms the anti-diabetic properties of tindora and purslane, which stimulate GLUT4 translocation in an insulin-like manner.

So far, little information is available on the response of this plant to combined drought and heat stress. In this study, changes in physiological and metabolic levels were characterized after treatments with drought, heat and combined stresses. Both individual and combined stress treatments increased malondialdehyde (MDA), electrolyte leakage (EL), O-2(center dot-) and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), while declined chlorophyll content. No significant differences were found between control and treatments in leaf water content (LVVC) and catalase (CAT) activity. Additionally, 37 metabolic compounds were detected in purslane. Through pathway analysis, 17 metabolites were directly involved in the glycolysis metabolic pathway. The present study indicated that combined drought and heat stress caused more serious damage in purslane than individual stress. To survive, purslane has a high capability to cope with environmental stress conditions through activation of physiological and metabolic pathways.

(purslane) is an edible plant with cosmopolitan distribution, traditionally consumed in the diet rich in green leafy vegetables. Methanol-aqueous extracts of purslane aerial parts from Bulgarian (POB) and Greek (POG) origin were evaluated for their antioxidant potential using radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing power. The studied accessions were also analyzed for total flavonoids, polyphenols and polysaccharides by pharmacopoeia) spectrophotometric methods. Both purslane extracts (POB and POG) revealed equal radical scavenging activity with IC50 values: 1.98 and 2.00 mg mL(-1) (DPPH), and 0.88 and 0.92 mg mL(-1) (ABTS), respectively, as well as similar polyphenol contents. POB had higher ferric reducing ability (0.16 mM Trolox equivalent TE) comparable with positive control chlorogenic acid (0.17 mM TE). The POG showed higher total flavonoids level (0.31 +/- 0.01%), but lower polysaccharides content (0.19 +/- 0.02%) was determined. In addition, the optimal extraction conditions for the highest yields of extracts, polyphenols and saponins were evaluated. It was found that the extraction by stirring at 80 degrees C gave the highest percentage yield of 16%, while the maximum polyphenols (3.45% +/- 0.83) and saponins (9.15% +/- 0.17) contents were achieved by Soxhlet extraction. P. oleracea with Bulgarian and Greek provenance have a significant potential against oxidative stress.

Pot experiment was conducted to quantify and simulate the response of purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.) plants to Cd toxicity. The purslane germinated seeds were cultivated in twelve Cd concentrations (from 0 to 300 mg/kg of Cd in soil) for six weeks and then some growth characteristics, photosynthesis pigments, and chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters were measured. The influence of Cd gradients in the soil on all growth parameters, photosynthesis pigments and chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters (except F (m) and carotenoid content) were described by a segmented model. Furthermore, F (m) and carotenoid contents were fitted to a linear model. The growth characteristics, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic pigments and some parameters of chlorophyll a fluorescence such as F (v), F (v)/F (m), Y(II) and ETR decreased when Cd concentration increased. In contrast, F (0), Y(NPQ) and Y(NO) increased and F (m) was not significantly affected. In general, most variations in the studied parameters were recorded with low concentrations of cadmium, which ranged from 0 to 125 mg/kg. Also, the growth characteristics (especially stem, leaf, and shoot dry weights) were more sensitive to Cd contamination than other parameters. Moreover, among chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, Y(NPQ) was the most sensitive to Cd concentration gradients in the soil that can be due to disturbances of antennae complex of PSII.

Four of the most common weeds in cotton, common purslane, false daisy, goosegrass, and lambsquarters, were manually sown in the cotton field and treated with glyphosate alone or in combination with insecticides. Glyphosate efficacy, based on visual estimates of control and weed fresh weight at 21 d after treatment (DAT), was unaffected by the addition of insecticides. Four weeds were controlled by 93-97% and 86-100% (visual rating) and reduced weed fresh biomass by 98-99% and 96-100% with glyphosate alone and its combination with insecticides, respectively. Addition of glyphosate to acephate improved cotton aphid control compared with acephate alone. However, addition of glyphosate to carbosulfan, endosulfan, imidacloprid, or lambda-cyhalothrin did not affect the aphid control when compared with the insecticide alone treatments. These results indicate that cotton producers could potentially integrate weed and insect management strategies by choosing suitable insecticide mixing partners with glyphosate, thereby reducing the application costs without sacrificing the efficacy of the glyphosate or the insecticides.

Nutritional value and chemical composition depended on genotype. Oxalic acid content was the lowest for genotype D, whereas genotypes E and F are more promising for commercial cultivation, since they have low oxalic acid content. Genotype E had a very good antioxidant profile and a balanced composition of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Regarding yield, genotype A had the highest yield comparing to the other genotypes, whereas commercial varieties (E and F) did not differ from genotypes B and C.

So far, there is little information on the combined response of this plant to drought and rehydration. In this study, physiological changes were measured under drought stress and rehydration conditions in purslane. Soil water content (SWC), leaf water content (LWC), malondialdehyde (MDA), proline, electrolyte leakage (EL), chlorophyll content, O-2(center dot-), SOD and POD activities were determined at designated time periods (5 d, 10 d, 15 d, 22 d after drought and 3 h, 1 d, 3 d after rehydration). Progressive drought treatment for 10 d significantly increased MDA, proline, EL, O-2(center dot-), and activities of SOD and POD, while rehydration for 1-3 d caused decline of these parameters. Conversely, drought stress decreased LWC and chlorophyll content, while rehydration increased LWC quickly and chlorophyll content gradually. The present study indicated that the purslane has a great capability to cope with drought stress and activate many physiological mechanisms, which allow more efficient recovery during rehydration. These results provided the first physiological evidences that the harvest time for purslane was within 5-10 d of drought or 1-3 d after rehydration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Zaleya pentandra is an emerging invasive weed of the arid areas of Pakistan. We investigated the effects of different dormancy breaking treatments on the germination of Z. pentandra seeds. Seeds were treated with hot water (by placing them in boiling water for 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 min), dry heat (by placing them in a preheated oven at 70 degrees C for 1, 2, and 4 hours; at 70 degrees C for 1, 2, 3, and 4 days, and at 200 degrees C for 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 min) and stratification (by placing them at 2-5 degrees C in a refrigerator for 5, 10, 30, and 60 min; for 3, 6, and 12 hours, and for 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, and 30 days). Seeds also were soaked in thiourea ([(NH2)(2) CS] (0, 2,500, 5,000, 7,500, and 10,000 mg L-1 for 24 h at 30 degrees C) and in KNO3 (0, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 40,000, 50,000, and 60,000 mg L-1 for 24 h at 30 degrees C). Additionally, seeds were scarified with HCl (for 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 h), HNO3 (for 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 h), and H2SO4 (for 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 min at 30 degrees C) and also mechanically scarified with sandpaper. Zaleya pentandra seeds showed typical signs of hard seed coat dormancy. Mechanical scarification and acid treatments promoted seed germination to a varying degree. Seed scarification with HNO3 for 12 to 18 h as well as with HCl for 12 h and 15 h was efficient in breaking dormancy of Z. pentandra seeds, providing germination up to 92.5%. Seed scarification with H2SO4 from 20 to 120 min showed little effect, whereas hot water, dry heat, stratification and various concentrations of thiourea and KNO3 were ineffective in breaking Z. pentandra seed dormancy.

This study aimed to evaluate the phytochemical composition of plant species called unconventional vegetables: purslane (Portulaca oleracea), bertalha (Basella rubra), pigweed (Amaranthus viridis), peixinho (Stachis lanata) and sorrel (Rumex acetosa), as well as the food potential based on the value of these characteristics. With respect to minerals, pigweed showed the highest levels of nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, sulfur and iron. The highest content of phenolic compounds was detected in peixinho, as well as the lowest concentration of condensed tannins (0,14 Eag/g extract). Regarding total carotenoids, pigweed had the highest concentration, but the content of beta-carotene was higher for peixinho, sorrel type I and bertalha. The methanolic extract of peixinho presented a strong sequestration capacity of free radical. The highest proportion of protein was detected in sorrel (type I and II). The levels of protein, minerals and bioactive compounds found in these unconventional vegetables, characterize these vegetables with high nutritional potential, so that their regular consumption can bring benefits to human health.

The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of different drying on retention of bioactive molecules, such as omega-3 fatty acids, total phenolic content and antiradical activity of purslane. Five different dehydration methods including microwave (100 MW, 5 min), tray, vacuum, low temperature low humidity, infrared were used at 55-60 A degrees C for 5-7 h for dehydration of purslane. Three solvents, viz. water, ethanol and methanol were used for extraction of bioactive molecules from purslane. Total polyphenol content, antiradical activity and rehydration ratio of the bioactive molecules were determined. Results revealed that total PUFA, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), total polyphenol content and antiradical activity were found to retain in the dried purslane in the range of (47.9-59.9 %), (42.5-50 %), (188-408GAE/100 g) and (33.0-88.8 mg/100 g) respectively. The highest values of ALA, total polyphenol content and antiradical activity were found to obtain in the vacuum dried sample. Rehydration ratio was found in the range of 3.2-4.3 and vacuum dried purslane showed maximum rehydration. It could be concluded that vacuum dehydration of purslane is an effective method for retention of bioactive molecules and good rehydration behaviour of dried purslane.

We have developed purslane as a model system for exploring plant responses to stress. We exposed two varieties of purslane to saline stress with the objective of identifying differences between the varieties in the plasticity of morphological and physiological traits. The varieties responded to saline stress with significantly different changes in the measured traits, which included inter alia biomass, flower counts, proline concentrations and betalain pigment concentrations. The alternative responses of the two varieties consisted of complex, simultaneous changes in multiple traits. In particular, we observed that while both varieties increased production of betalain pigments and proline under saline stress, one variety invested more in betalain pigments while the other invested more in proline. Proline and betalain pigments undoubtedly play multiple roles in plant tissues, but in this case their role as antioxidants deployed to ameliorate saline stress appears to be important. Taken holistically, our results suggest that the two varieties employ different strategies in allocating resources to cope with saline stress. This conclusion establishes purslane as a suitable model system for the study of saline stress and the molecular basis for differential responses.

Treatments were initiated on 1 Apr. 2011 and 28 Mar. 2012 and consisted of a nontreated control, isoxaben (2.2 kg a.i./ha), oryzalin (4.5 kg a.i./ha), oxadiazon (3.36 kg a.i./ha), and mesotrione (0.14 kg a.i./ha). Hardwood mulch was applied to half of each plot following herbicide application. Weed counts, combined across species (camphorweed, texas croton, lanceleaf sage, pinnate tansymustard, tumble pigweed, common purslane, and prostrate spurge), were conducted to assess % weed cover at 4 and 12 weeks after treatment (WAT). In 2011, compared with the nonmulched no herbicide treatment, adding mulch reduced weed counts by 23 and increased weed control by 70% 4 WAT. All preemergence herbicide treatments, regardless of mulching regime, resulted in >= 97% weed control 4 WAT with the exception of oryzalin without mulch (91% weed control, 3 weeds/plot). In 2012, compared with the nonmulched no herbicide treatment, adding mulch reduced weed counts by 35 and increased weed control by 64% 4 WAT. Mulching in combination with mesotrione resulted in 100% weed control, significantly greater than mesotrione applied without mulch (98%, 2 weeds/plot) 4 WAT. Oryzalin without mulch resulted in greater weed control (94%, 4 weeds/plot) in 2012 4 WAT; however, this treatment provided the least amount of weed control of all preemergence herbicides tested. By 12 WAT, weed counts were reduced by 21 and 22 in 2011 and 2012, respectively, in response to mulching in the nontreated plots resulting in a 52% and 42% increase in weed control in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Mesotrione was the only treatment affected by mulching regime 12 WAT in 2011 and 2012. Mesotrione in combination with mulch resulted in 100% weed control in 2011 and 2012, while mesotrione without mulch resulted in 93% weed control (3 and 4 weeds/plot) 12 WAT in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Although not statistically significant, isoxaben applied alone in 2011 resulted in >= 97% weed control (1 weed/plot), while isoxaben in combination with mulch resulted in 94% weed control (3 weeds/plot) 12 WAT. In 2011, oryzalin and oxadiazon resulted in 87% to 92% control, regardless of mulching regime 12 WAT. Weed control in response to isoxaben in 2012 was 95% 12 WAT, regardless of mulching regime. The combination of oxadiazon + mulch resulted in similar weed control (95%, 3 weeds/plot) 12 WAT; however, oxadiazon alone and oryzalin with and without mulch resulted in 87% to 89% weed control. All preemergence herbicides evaluated provided good to excellent weed control. Isoxaben and oryzalin are labeled for use on nonbearing fruit trees or during orchard establishment, while oxadiazon is only labeled for woody ornamentals. Although not labeled for use in orchards, mesotrione may be an alternative for use in olive production. The addition of mulching did not increase weed control except when used in conjunction with mesotrione. Mulch alone provided moderate weed control when preemergence herbicides were not applied. Furthermore, the utilization of mulch in combination with preemergence herbicides may help reduce photodegradation and/or volatilization when irrigation/rainfall is limited.

During hot seasons, P.oleracea frequently becomes monodominant in choy sum (Brassica parachinensis) fields in Guangzhou city, southern China. Here, we studied the seasonal dynamics of P.oleracea's germinable soil seedbank, population density and above-ground biomass in choy sum fields that had been cultivated continuously for several years. Using P.oleracea seeds collected from these fields, we tested seed dormancy, survival and germination, seedling growth and generation time. Portulaca oleracea occurred at high levels during the hot season, but its occurrence was low, and the germinable soil seedbank was much greater during the cold season. The weed's opportunistic characteristics allowed it to avoid freezing and to proliferate during optimal conditions. Portulaca oleracea's generation time was very flexible, as short as 31days during the hot season, but longer than 100days during the colder season. Seed dormancy tended to be shorter when the seeds were stored at a higher temperature. At a temperature of 35 degrees C, both seed germination and seedling growth showed advantages over those of choy sum. Storage for oneyear at a temperature of -20 degrees C or burial in a paddy field did not significantly reduce P.oleracea seed germination. Nevertheless, seed storage at a temperature of 15 degrees C and soil coverage of 0.5cm on top of the seeds significantly constrained seed germination. Stale seedbed' and/or coverage of the surface with soil are recommended during the hot season. However, rotation of rice and upland crops is not an efficient method for managing Portulaca oleracea infestation.

The experiments were laid out in a split-plot design with two main plots (conventional and minimum tillage) and four sub-plots (fertilization regimes). The results indicated that weed biomass and density in quinoa were influenced by the different fertilization and tillage treatments. Moreover, seed yield in conventional was 5%-13% higher than that of minimum tillage, probably due to the lower weed density and biomass. Concerning fertilization treatments, total weed density and biomass increased under manure application and inorganic fertilization. Tillage effects on weeds were species specific. The density of perennial weeds such as purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.) and the density of small-seeded weeds such as redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) and common purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.) were significantly lower under the conventional tillage than under the minimum tillage system.

The crop was machine-transplanted in late spring of each year. Pretransplant (PRETP) herbicide treatments included two S-metolachlor rates (534 and 1,070 g ai ha(-1)), two clomazone rates (560 and 1,120 g ai ha(-1)), and four tank mixes of S-metolachlor plus clomazone (534 + 560 g ha(-1), 1,070 + 560 g ha(-1), 534 + 1,120 g ha(-1), and 1,070 + 1,120 g ha(-1)). Crop injury and weed control data were collected at 2 and 4 wk after treatment (WAT). The crop was harvested two times from August to September. Minor crop injury was observed at 2 WAT only in 2006 and in plots treated with S-metolachlor, alone or in combination with clomazone. In 2007, slight crop injury at 6 WAT in most herbicide-treated plots was mostly related to weeds that grew regardless of herbicide treatment. In general, S-metolachlor provided less weed control than did clomazone or tank mixes of S-metolachlor plus clomazone. Clomazone did not reduce yield of banana pepper. Registration of clomazone would provide banana pepper growers an opportunity to control weeds caused by late emergence or poor initial control following a burndown herbicide application.

To evaluate the potential of producing S. glance as a vegetable at moderate NaCl concentrations, plants were grown in nutrient solutions with 6, 8, and 10 mm NaCl, and with 200 mm NaCl as a control. Results showed that main stem length, true leaf number, side branch number, and canopy width of plants in 6-10 mm NaCl were not significantly different from those in 200 MM. Also, no significant differences in fresh and dry weights of individual plants, marketable yield, and water use efficiency of the plants were observed between 6-10 and 200 mm NaCl treatments. Despite remarkable decreases in sodium uptake, similar water consumptions by the plants were obtained in 6-10 vs. 200 mM NaCl. The results suggest that S. glauca is a potential candidate for hydroponic production as a vegetable at moderate NaCl salinity, since growth attributes and biomass accumulation were not reduced when grown at lower salinity levels, despite with decreased sodium uptake.

The cuttings exhibited effective regeneration in Hoagland solution in comparison to deionized water. Plants demonstrated significant reduction in growth (root and shoot length, leaf area), biomass (root and shoot dry weight), pigments (total chlorophylls and carotenoids) and total soluble sugar content at higher concentration of Cr(VI) (10mg/L). However, plants could tolerate Cr stress through significantly higher accumulation of proline and increased activity of peroxidase resulting in significant Cr accumulation (150-190mg/kg dry weight) in harvestable parts of Portulaca.

The previous research with this product is limited to cool-season turfgrass systems with little information available on appropriate application rates or weed control spectrum for weeds common to warm-season turf. Studies were conducted to evaluate application rates and weed control spectrum of P. macrostoma on common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale G.H. Weber ex Wigg.), slender aster (Aster subulatus var. ligulatus Shinners), common mallow (Malva neglecta Wallr.), common purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.), California burclover (Medicago polymorpha L.), and annual sow thistle (Sonchus oleraceus L.). Although most weeds exhibited susceptibility to P. macrostoma, control differed by weed species and study. P. macrostoma had the greatest efficacy on dandelion, but provided little efficacy on common purslane and common mallow. Warm-season turfgrass tolerance was also evaluated across five commonly used warm-season turfgrass species. No turfgrass injury was observed at any rate on any species; however, weed control data suggest that P. macrostoma may not offer effective broad-spectrum weed control similar to common synthetic herbicides, when applied at the rates used in this study.

The effects of microwave output power and sample amount on ascorbic acid loss in basil, purslane and celery leaves were investigated. The method for the determination of ascorbic acid content was based on the reaction between ascorbic acid and 2,6-dichloroindophenol and was successfully applied to basil, purslane and celery leaves. Increasing microwave output power and decreasing sample amount led to higher degradation rates in basil, purslane and celery leaves. Ascorbic acid degradation kinetics in basil, purslane and celery leaves during microwave drying followed a first-order reaction. The activation energy values were also calculated using an exponential expression based on Arrhenius equation for degradation of ascorbic acid.

The 10 primers gave a total of ninety five bands among which 95 were polymorphic (100 %). The genetic diversity as estimated by Shannon's information index was 1.85, revealing a high level of genetic diversity in the germplasm. The average numbers of observed allele, effective allele, expected heterozygosity, polymorphic information content (PIC), and Nei's information index were 9.5, 5.14, 0.81, 0.33, 0.77, and 0.79, respectively. The UP-GMA dendrogram based on Nei's genetic distance grouped the whole germplasm into eight distinct clusters. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that 71.87 % of total variation occurred within population while 28.13 % from among populations. Considering all these criteria and results from marker-assisted diversity analysis, accessions that are far apart based on their genetic coefficient (like Ac11 and Ac17; Ac4 and Ac42; Ac16 and Ac31; Ac38 and Ac17; Ac21 and Ac31; Ac30 and Ac10) could be selected as parents for further breeding programs.

Use of FS allows for influencing nutritional status and composition of plants modifying the nutrient solution (NS), particularly the final nitrate and oxalate contents, one important aspect in BLV. As in other hydroponic systems, plants grown in FS may suffer hypoxia because the roots gradually consume the oxygen dissolved in the NS. This work reviews the effect of the nitrogen concentration and chemical form supplied to the growing plants and the aeration level of the NS on the inherent quality of BLV. Studied species included rocket (Eruca sativa; Diplotaxis tenuifolia), lamb's lettuce (Valerianella olitoria), water and garden cress (Nasturtium officinalis; Lepidium sativum), lettuce (Lactuca sativa), purslane (Portulaca oleracea), spinach (Spinaca oleracea) and bladder campion (Silene vulgaris). For many species, concentrations from 4 to 16 mmol L-1 N were used in the NS and ratios between N-NO3- and N-NH4+ from 100 to 0% were applied. In general, 8-12 mmol L-1 N led to high yields and limited leaf NO3 accumulation and 40-60% of N-NH4+ limited leaf NO3 accumulation. With respect to the aeration levels of the NS, some species showed little sensitivity to oxygen depleted in the root medium, and were able to adapt to a gradual reduction in oxygen level. However, to increase yields, aeration is advisable, although the final quality of the product, in terms of functional phytochemicals concentrations, may be slightly lower. The level of oxygen had a different influence on the oxalate and nitrate contents depending on the studied species. "}

Objective: To evaluate purslane as a hepatoprotective agent, we investigated the protective effect of its ethanol extract against carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced hepatic toxicity in rats.  Materials and methods: A total of 108 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 12 groups. The first group was maintained as normal control, whereas CCl4 (0.5 ml/kg bw, 50% CCl4 in olive oil, i. p.), purslane extract (0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 g/kg bw, intragastrically), and purslane extract (five doses as above) along with CCl4 were administered to the Groups II, III-VII, and VIII-XII, respectively. The rats were sacrificed on the 30th day, and blood was withdrawn by cardiac puncture. Liver damage was assessed by measuring hepatic marker enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, and SOD) and histopathological observation.  Results: Treatment with CCl4 resulted in increased serum activities of marker enzymes with a concomitant decrease in SOD. Histological alterations were also observed in the liver tissue upon CCl4 treatment. Administration of purslane extract (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.15 g/kg b. w.) significantly showed a marked tendency towards normalization of all measured biochemical parameters in CCl4-treated rats. Histopathological changes also paralleled the detected alteration in markers of liver function.  Discussion and conclusion: These results demonstrate that purslane exerts protective effects against CCl4-induced damage in rat liver and supports a potential therapeutic use of purslane as an alternative for patients with liver diseases.

A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the role of rhizosphere interaction of sunflower and purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.) weed on cadmium (Cd) uptake and its allocation to sunflower grains. The experimental treatments consisted of two cropping systems (mono and mixed culture), two adjusted salinity levels (0 and 0.5% NaCl) and three artificial levels of Cd in soil (Control, 3 and 6 mg kg(-1)). The results showed that the growth of sunflower in the presence of purslane in comparison to mono culture of sunflower led to change of total Cd content and Cd allocated to grains only in saline conditions. Promoting effects of salinity on Cd concentration of grain were alleviated where sunflower was co-planted with purslane. Besides, supply of Zn in grains of co-planted sunflower was strongly affected by salinity. Results of this study revealed that although co-planted purslane could alter conditions in the shared rhizosphere, it had no effect on enhancing Cd uptake by neighboring sunflower directly.

Earlier studies have mostly indicated the beneficial effects in animal models. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of purslane seeds on glycemic status and lipid profiles of persons with type 2 diabetes. Materials and Methods: This cross-over randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted on 48 persons with type 2 diabetes. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 10 g/day purslane seeds with 240 cc low-fat yogurt (intervention group) or only 240 cc low-fat yogurt (as a control group) for 5 weeks. After a 2-week washout period, subjects were moved to the alternate arm for an additional 5 weeks. At baseline and end of each phase of the study, fasting blood samples were collected to quantify plasma glucose levels, as well as serum insulin and lipid profiles. Within-group and between-group changes in anthropometric measures, as well as biochemical indicators, were compared using a paired-samples t-test. Results: Mean age of study participants was 51.4 +/- 6.0 year. We found a significant reduction in weight (-0.57 vs. 0.09 kg, P = 0.003) and body mass index (-0.23 vs. 0.02 kg/m(2), P = 0.004) following purslane seeds consumption. Despite a slight reduction in fasting plasma glucose levels (-2.10 vs. -2.77 mg/dL, P = 0.90), we failed to find any significant effect on serum insulin levels and homeostatic model of assessment of insulin resistance score. Furthermore, purslane consumption decreased serum triglyceride levels (-25.5 vs. -1.8 mg/dL, P = 0.04) but could not affect serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol levels. We observed a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (-3.33 vs. 0.5 mmHg, P = 0.01) and a borderline significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure (-3.12 vs. -0.93 mmHg, P = 0.09) after purslane seeds intake. Conclusion: In summary, consumption of purslane seeds for 5 weeks in persons with type 2 diabetes might improve their anthropometric measures, serum triglyceride levels, and blood pressure. Further studies are required to determine the appropriate dosage for these patients.

(purslane). Seed germination was reduced upon treatment with P. oleracea extracts. The activities of the four antioxidant enzymes as well as the antioxidant proline were increased under the treatment. Protein, Chl a, Chl b, total chlorophyll and total carotenoids were decreased depending on the extract concentration. Leaf extract of P. oleracea showed more allelopathic potential than root extract which may reveal the high and diverse bioactive compounds in the leaves of this weed.

Salinity effect was evaluated on the basis of biomass yield reduction, physiological attributes, and stem-root anatomical changes. Aggravated salinity stress caused significant (P < 0.05) reduction in all measured parameters and the highest salinity showed more detrimental effect compared to control as well as lower salinity levels. The fresh and dry matter production was found to increase in Ac1, Ac9, and Ac13 fromlower to higher salinity levels but others were badly affected. Considering salinity effect on purslane physiology, increase in chlorophyll content was seen in Ac2, Ac4, Ac6, and Ac8 at 16 dS m(-1) salinity, whereas Ac4, Ac9, and Ac12 showed increased photosynthesis at the same salinity levels compared to control. Anatomically, stem cortical tissues of Ac5, Ac9, and Ac12 were unaffected at control and 8 dS m(-1) salinity but root cortical tissues did not show any significant damage except a bit enlargement in Ac12 and Ac13. A dendrogram was constructed by UPGMA based on biomass yield and physiological traits where all 13 accessions were grouped into 5 clusters proving greater diversity among them. The 3-dimensional principal component analysis (PCA) has also confirmed the output of grouping from cluster analysis. Overall, salinity stressed among all 13 purslane accessions considering biomass production, physiological growth, and anatomical development Ac9 was the best salt-tolerant purslane accession and Ac13 was the most affected accession.

The 28 primers gave a total of 167 bands, among which 163 were polymorphic (97.6%). The genetic diversity as estimated by Shannon's information index was 0.513, revealing a quite high level of genetic diversity in the germplasm. The average number of observed allele, effective allele, expected heterozygosity, polymorphic information content (PIC) and Nei's index were 5.96, 1.59, 0.43, 0.35 and 0.35, respectively. The UPGMA dendrogram based on Nei's genetic distance grouped the whole germplasm into 7 distinct clusters. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed that 89% of total variation occurred within population, while 11% were found among populations. Based on the constructed dendrogram using ISSR markers those accessions that are far from each other by virtue of genetic origin and diversity index (like Ad l and Ac42; Ac19 and Ac45; Ac9 and Ac23; Ac18 and A25; Ac24 and Ac18) are strongly recommended to select as parent for future breeding program to develop high yielding and stress tolerant purslane variety in contribution to global food security.

It has a wide range of pharmacological effects, such as antibacterial, anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidative properties. Although the extract of purslane has numerous beneficial pharmacological effects, its effect on osteoclasts remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the anti-osteoclastogenic activity in vitro and in vivo and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. The effect of purslane on the differentiation and function of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) into osteoclasts was examined using a phenotype assay such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, F-actin staining, and pit assay and followed by confirmation by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis. To address the effect of purslane in vivo, the inflammatory, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced osteolysis mouse model was chosen. Bone volume and bone microarchitecture were evaluated by microcomputed tomography and histologic analysis. Purslane inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL)-stimulated osteoclast differentiation accompanied by inhibition of Akt/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta) signaling, which could underlie purslane-induced downregulation of c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) expression levels, transcription factors that regulate osteoclast-specific genes, as well as osteoclast fusion and resorption-related molecules. Moreover, in vivo studies further verified the bone protection activity of purslane in the LPS-induced osteolysis animal model. Purslane could exhibit its anti-osteoclastogenic activity by inhibiting Akt/GSK3 beta-c-Fos-NFATc1 signaling cascades. Therefore, purslane is a potential natural medicine for the treatment of osteoclast-related diseases.

(PO) that could provide synergism with antibiotics against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and their possible mechanisms of resistance inhibition.  Methods High-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and a panel of laboratory MRSA strains were used for checkerboard and efflux inhibitory assays.  Key findings Linoleic and oleic acids were identified from HSCCC fraction 18 of PO with synergistic antibacterial activity when combined with erythromycin against RN4220/pUL5054. Ethidium bromide efflux inhibitory studies revealed that linoleic and oleic acids may interfere the activity of MsrA pump. By comparing among a panel of linoleic and oleic acids analogues, unsaturated fatty acids in salt form with cis configuration and an increase in number of double bonds were found to further increase the antibacterial activity when used alone or in combination with antibiotics.  Conclusion This study reported for the first time that two active ingredients, namely linoleic and oleic acids, were identified from PO with synergistic antibacterial activity when combined with erythromycin against MRSA RN4220/pUL5054 and possibly act by inhibiting the efflux pumps of the bacteria cells.

This study aimed to evaluate the salinity reduction of experimental saline solutions through the ions uptake capability of purslane (Portulaca oleracea), as well as its biomass accumulation. The hydroponic system used contained three different nutrient solutions composed of fixed concentrations of macro and micronutrients to which three different concentrations of sodium chloride had been added. Two conditions were tested, clipped and intact plants. It was observed that despite there being a notable removal of magnesium and elevated biomass accumulation, especially in the intact plants, purslane did not present the expected removal quantity of sodium and chloride. We confirmed that in the research conditions of the present study, purslane is a saline-tolerant species but accumulation of sodium and chloride was not shown as previously described in the literature.

In the 5 years of the study, 50 to 100% of the transplant lots sampled arrived infested with thrips. Among infested transplant lots, the overall number of thrips averaged 0.15 to 0.63 per plant, with as many as four per plant in some lots. T. tabaci was the dominant thrips species in all seasons and locations of transplant origin. In addition, 19 of 83 (23%) tested lots had plants positive for Iris yellow spot virus. Iris yellow spot virus and T. tabaci were detected in volunteer onion plants as early as 1 May, a few weeks after the summer onion crop was planted, suggesting a possible role of infected volunteer plants in perennation of the virus between onion crops. Iris yellow spot virus and T. tabaci were detected in many common weeds including blue mustard (Chorispora tenella (Pall.) DC), common purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.), field bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis L.), flixweed (Descurainia sophia Webb & Berth.), prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola L.), and redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) in early spring near onion fields in Colorado during 2006 to 2009. Confirmation that Iris yellow spot virus and Iris yellow spot virus-infective thrips overwintered in volunteer onions and some common winter annual and perennial weeds emphasizes that managing volunteer onions and weeds is important for management of iris yellow spot, in addition to planting transplants free of thrips and the pathogen.

One hundred and ninety two 1-day old broiler chicks (Ross 308) were allocated randomly in 4 groups with 4 replicates to receive diets supplemented with 0 (control), 100, 200 and 300 ppm of purslane extract for 42 days. Body weight gain, feed intake (FI) and feed conversion ratio were measured weekly and calculated for starter (1-21 d), grower (22-42 d) and overall periods (1-42 d). All diets were isocaloric, isonitrogenous and provided ad libitum. Antibody response against sheep red blood cell (SRBC) was measured on d-28 and d-42. At the age of 42 d, eight chicks per treatment killed aseptically for enumeration of cecal bacteria. The results of this experiment indicated that FI increased significantly with inclusion of purslane extract in grower and overall period (p <= 0.05). Purslane extract did not affect coliform and Escherichia coli populations but increased Lactobacillus population of cecal content significantly (p <= 0.05). There were no significant differences in primary and secondary antibody titer against SRBC and no differences among the treatments for relative weight of thymus and spleen (p > 0.05).

Material and methods: Purslane (P) (400 mg/kg body weight) or fish oil (Fo) (60 mg/kg body weight) was administrated to male albino rats via gastric intubation for 15 days after whole body exposure to a single dose of 6 Gy gamma rays. The animals were sacrificed after the elapse of 15 days.  Results: The results revealed that irradiation induced a significant elevation of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and atherogenic index: TC/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) in addition to aspartate and alanine transaminase (AST, ALT), alkaline phophatase (ALP), bilirubin, as well as urea, creatinine and uric acid. Moreover, liver, kidney and heart malondialdehyde (MDA) was significantly elevated, whereas nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and HDL-c were depressed. Purslane and/or fish oil treatment significantly attenuated lipids alteration, liver and kidney functions as well as oxidative stress in irradiated rats. The results pointed out that dietary fish oil supplementation, at adequate doses, may provide a cushion for a prolonged therapeutic option against radiation-induced damage without harmful side-effects.  Conclusion: It could be concluded that purslane extract and fish oil may have therapeutic potential to improve hepatic and renal functions as well as oxidative stress in irradiated rats. Moreover, their co-administration showed a better improved liver function. ", "Writer": "  By:Abd El-Azime, ASH (Abd El-Azime, Afrag S.

From the ancient ages purslane has been treated as a major weed of vegetables as well as other crops. However, worldwide researchers and nutritionists have studied this plant as a potential vegetable crop for humans as well as animals. Purslane is a nutritious vegetable with high antioxidant properties and recently has been recognized as the richest source of alpha-linolenic acid, essential omega-3 and 6 fatty acids, ascorbic acid, glutathione, alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene. The lack of vegetable sources of omega-3 fatty acids has resulted in a growing level of attention to introduce purslane as a new cultivated vegetable. In the rapid-revolutionizing worldwide atmosphere, the ability to produce improved planting material appropriate to diverse and varying rising conditions is a supreme precedence. Though various published reports on morphological, physiological, nutritional and medicinal aspects of purslane are available, research on the genetic improvement of this promising vegetable crop are scant. Now it is necessary to conduct research for the genetic improvement of this plant. Genetic improvement of purslane is also a real scientific challenge. Scientific modernization of conventional breeding with the advent of advance biotechnological and molecular approaches such as tissue culture, protoplast fusion, genetic transformation, somatic hybridization, marker-assisted selection, qualitative trait locus mapping, genomics, informatics and various statistical representation have opened up new opportunities of revising the relationship between genetic diversity, agronomic performance and response to breeding for varietal improvement. This review is an attempt to amalgamate the assorted scientific information on purslane propagation, cultivation, varietal improvement, nutrient analyses, medicinal uses and to describe prospective research especially for genetic improvement of this crop.

{"Title": "A Rapid Extraction and Analysis Method for the Simultaneous Determination of 26 Bioflavonoids in Portulaca Oleracea L.", "Url": "https://apps.webofknowledge.com/full_record.do?product=WOS&search_mode=GeneralSearch&qid=1&SID=Q1EgjZyvo1xjISgjB73&page=7&doc=65", "Abstract": "  IntroductionPortulaca oleracea L. (P. oleracea, purslane) is an edible plant that is widely distributed around the world, and flavonoids are its main bioactive constituents. Therefore, the detection of flavonoids is very important for a better understanding of its pharmacological actions and to monitor the product quality control of P. oleracea.  ObjectiveTo develop a rapid method to extract and determine 26 bioflavonoids in P. oleracea, based on microwave extraction (MWE) and triple quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometry.  MethodsThe optimal conditions of MWE for the extraction of flavonoids from P. oleracea involved the use of methanol as the extraction solvent, a microwave power of 300 W, an extraction time of 450 s, and a solvent-to-solid ratio of 30 mL/g. The samples were analysed using an ultra-performance liquid chromatograph coupled with a triple quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS) system.  ResultsThe calibration curves of all 26 analytes showed good linearity (r 0.999) and the intra- and interday precisions and repeatability were all within required limits. The mean recoveries measured at three concentrations were higher than 94.2%, with RSDs lower than 2.94% for the targets.  ConclusionThe established MWE/UPLC-MS/MS method is a rapid and effective method for quality evaluation of P. oleracea from different production regions and different harvest periods. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  The method takes 450 s to extract the 26 flavonoids in P. oleracea from ten batches and 18 minutes to quantify the components using MWE/UPLC-MS/MS. This is the first time that one analysis method was able to allow such a rapid extraction and the detection of 26 flavonoids simultaneously. This approach appears promising for use in the quality control of purslane and it also has great reference value for the extraction and determination of flavonoids in other complex systems.

A kinetic model based on a mechanism involving two consecutive reactions was developed to describe the changes in the phenolic content of fresh-cut produce during storage. Experimental data for purslane stored at 0 and 5 degrees C, apples and broccoli stored at 5 degrees C, as well as literature data for 'Lisbon' lemon and 'Palazzelli' mandarin samples were used to validate the model, which is consistent with the phenol changes under all of the studied conditions. By estimating model parameters, individually or as group, the storage temperature did not affect the de novo synthesis of phenols but did affect the oxidative degradation for purslane samples. For apples and broccoli samples, biological variability was very important and affected the initial phenolic content and synthesis. Moreover the model also explained the phenolic variation on mandarin segments and on cut lemons. The type of cut for lemon samples had a significant effect on the rate of synthesis of phenols, with an increase of 1.8-fold being observed for the 1/2 slice compared to the slices. The model may be a useful tool for obtaining a better understanding of the effects of processing and storage conditions on the changes in the phenolic content and improving the shelf life prediction of fresh-cut produce.

Methods: Male Wistar rats (n=12) were fed on 1% cholesterol-enriched diet for 10 days. After this phase, hypercholesterolemic rats (HC) were divided into two groups fed the same diet supplemented or not with Portulaca oleracea (Po-HC) (0.5%) for four weeks.  Results: Serum total cholesterol (TC) and triacylglycerols (TG), and liver TG values were respectively 1.6-, 1.8-, and 1.6-fold lower in Po-HC than in HC group. Cholesterol concentrations in LDL-HDLi, HDL2, and HDL3 were respectively 1.8, 1.4-, and 2.4-fold decreased in Po-HC group. HDL2 and HDL3 amounts, which were the sum of apolipoproteins (apos), TG, cholesteryl esters (CE), unesterified cholesterol (UC), and phospholipids (PL) contents, were respectively 4.5-fold higher and 1.2-fold lower with Po treatment. Indeed, enhanced LCAT activity (1.2-fold), its cofactor-activator apo A-I (2-fold) and its reaction product HDL2-CE (2.1-fold) were observed, whereas HDL3-PL (enzyme substrate) and HDL3-UC (acyl group acceptor) were 1.2- and 2.4-fold lower.  Conclusion: Portulaca oleracea reduces triglyceridemia, cholesterolemia, and improves reverse cholesterol transport in rat fed enriched-cholesterol diet, contributing to anti-atherogenic effects.

An experiment was conducted to evaluate the role of belowground interaction of soybean and purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.) weed on cadmium (Cd) uptake and its allocation to soybean grains. The experimental treatments included two cropping systems (mono and mixed culture), two salinity levels (0% and 0.5% NaCl) and three levels of Cd in soil (control; 3 and 6 mg Cd/kg). Results showed that the promoting effect of salinity on Cd uptake by soybean and Cd allocation to grains was enhanced in the presence of purslane compared to the absence of neighbour plant. This could be due to increasing Cd-mobilization within the shared rhizosphere of plants. In the non-saline soil decreasing uptake and grain allocation of Cd in co-planted soybean was associated with enhancing of purslane Cd uptake and the depletion of Cd in soil solution. Therefore, it can be concluded that co-planted purslane can alter the uptake of cadmium to the neighboring soybean plants; its effect may be influenced by soil environmental conditions such as salinity.

Field experiments were conducted in 2009 and 2010 to determine the influence of row spacing (15, 25 and 35cm) and emergence time of E.colona and T.portulacastrum (0, 15, 25, 35, 45 and 55days after maize emergence; DAME) on weed growth and productivity of maize. A season-long weed-free treatment and a weedy control were also used to estimate maize yield and weed seed production. Crop row spacing as well as weed emergence time had a significant influence on plant height, shoot biomass and seed production of both weed species and grain yield of maize in both years. Delay in emergence of weeds resulted in less plant height, shoot biomass and seed production. However, increase in productivity of maize was observed by delay in weed emergence. Likewise, growth of both weed species was less in narrow row spacing (15cm) of maize, as compared with wider rows (25 and 35cm). Maximum seed production of both weeds was observed in weedy control plots, where there was no competition with maize crop and weeds were in rows 35cm apart. Nevertheless, maximum plant height, shoot biomass and seed production of both weed species were observed in 35cm rows, when weeds emerged simultaneously with maize. Both weed species produced only 3-5 seeds per plant, when they were emerged at 55 DAME in crop rows spaced at 15cm. Infestation of both weeds at every stage of crop led to significant crop yield loss in maize. Our results suggested that narrow row spacing and delay in weed emergence led to reduced weed growth and seed production and enhanced maize grain yield and therefore could be significant constituents of integrated weed management strategies in maize.

To evaluate the potential of producing S. bigelovii hydroponically as a vegetable at moderate NaCl concentrations, plants were grown in nutrient solutions with 6, 8, and 10 mm NaCl, and with 200 mm NaCl as a control. Results showed that plants had a reduced main stem length, canopy width, stem diameter, and root system length in 6 to 10 mm NaCl compared with those in 200 mm. Also, fresh weight increase, fresh and dry weights of individual plants, marketable yield, and water use efficiency of the plants grown in solutions with 6 to 10 mm NaCl were significantly lower than those grown in 200 mm. Associated with the reduced growth attributes, remarkable decreases in sodium uptake by the plants were also obtained in 6 to 10 vs. 200 mm NaCl. The results suggest that S. bigelovii is not a good candidate for hydroponic production as a vegetable at moderate NaCl salinity resulting from reduced growth attributes, which are possibly associated with decreased sodium uptake.

Our recent study showed that this crop can be produced hydroponically in NaCl-rich nutrient solutions. Increased NaCl salinity has been found to increase the occurrence of Ca-deficiency related disorders in many horticultural crops. To explore the effects of NaCl on calcium-deficiency disorder and the associated impacts on plant growth in purslane, two commercial cultivars 'Green' and 'Golden' were hydroponically grown in nutrient solutions without Ca for the first 3 wk (Ca-deficiency period) and then in nutrient solutions with added 2.4 mM Ca(NO3)(2) for 2 wk (Ca-supplement period). Two levels of NaCl (0 and 10 mM) were used in the above nutrient solutions as the two NaCl treatments (control and NaCl). Plants began to express visual symptoms first on the apical leaves and then on the apical stems 12 d after the start of Ca deficiency treatment, but recovered from the disorder during the following Ca-supplement period, suggesting that the symptoms were caused by Ca-deficiency. During the Ca-deficiency period (early stage of symptoms development), NaCl alleviated the Ca-deficiency disorder and reduced leaf unfolding rate in the 'Green' cultivar, but not in the 'Golden' cultivar. However, during the Ca-supplement period (late stage of symptoms development) exposure to NaCl increased the severity of the disorder and inhibited stem extension and leaf unfolding for both purslane cultivars. The results suggest that purslane Ca-deficiency disorder responses to NaCl vary with symptom development and cultivars, and that the responses are associated with changes in plant growth.

The aim of this work is to reconstruct the history of P. oleracea aggregate in the Emilia-Romagna Po Plain, by discovering the microspecies that have lived in this region. A qualitative study was carried out to determine the microspecies documented in the archaeological sites of Emilia-Romagna, from the Roman to Medieval/Renaissance periods. A comparison between archaeological seeds and recent and present records was made by sampling in historical herbaria and field collections. Seven different microspecies were identified: Portulaca papillatostellulata, P. trituberculata, P. cypria, P. sativa, P. oleracea (all hexaploid); P. granulatostellulata and P. nitida (both tetraploid=4x). They are distinguished on the basis of seed coat morphology. The findings in archaeological sites and in the present collections are discussed. Two independent events of European colonization could be proposed: First to arrive were the hexaploid (6x) species, followed by the tetraploid species. In future, the application of similar analyses to the well-preserved archaeobotanical remains of purslane, particularly the microspecies from America, could be a good way to understand the history of this interesting species aggregate from a chronological and geographical standpoint.

Weed control practices and infestations in pecan were divided between winter and summer seasons. The most troublesome pecan winter weed species were wild radish and Italian ryegrass, whereas the most troublesome summer season weeds were Palmer amaranth and bermudagrass. Other weeds included crabgrass species, bahiagrass, Florida pusley, purslane species, morningglory species, curly dock, and cutleaf evening-primrose. The most widely used POST herbicide in both the winter and summer season was glyphosate. The most commonly used year-round herbicides with soil persistence were pendimethalin, diuron, flumioxazin, halosulfuron, simazine, indaziflam, and oryzalin. Use of multiple herbicides, PRE- and POST-contact and soil-persistent, with various herbicide mechanisms of action, have benefited pecan producers by providing year-round weed control, despite herbicide-resistant weeds being widely established in this region.

In this study, we examined the effects of Purslane polysaccharides (PPs) on the oxidative injury and immune status in N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)-induced gastric cancer rats. PPs administration (200, 400 or 800 mg/kg body weight) could not only increase the body weight, peripheral white blood cells (WBC) count, thymus and spleen indexes, but also remarkably promote splenocytes proliferation of gastric cancer rats. Furthermore, the production of serum cytokines in gastric cancer rats, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was enhanced by PPs treatment. Besides, treatment with PPs was found to provide a dose-dependent protection against MNNG-induced oxidative injury by enhancing SOD, CAT, GSH-Px activities of gastric cancer rats. Taken together, we concluded that enhancement of antioxidants and immune response might be responsible for the anticancer effect of PPs in gastric cancer. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Accessions were classified by their different seed coat characteristics using a scanning microscope. Molecular analysis was carried out using the ISSR technique with 10 primers, producing a total of 141 DNA bands, 85 of which were polymorphic among the accessions. A dendrogram drawn on the basis of a similarity matrix using the UPGMA algorithm revealed that the 60 samples of purslane plants could be classified into two major clusters at a Jaccard's genetic similarity index of 0.32, confirming that genetic variation was very high among and within accessions. An analysis of the morphological, agronomical and biochemical traits was a less efficient way of grouping the accessions due to the high inter-population variability observed for the analyzed traits used. Among all accessions, CM 13-00809 presented a high yield, a high dry matter content, high potassium level, low oxalate level and an attractive green colour of the stem and leaves, which, taken together, make it an attractive candidate for consumption as a ready-to-eat product. In addition, the variations that exist in the desired traits within and among accessions in the germplasm could give rise to a breeding programme to develop Portulaca oleracea cultivars as a high quality, minimally processed product.

In these newer articles, the identification of FM is being performed using gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). In the present commentary the general scheme of FA biosynthesis in plants is reviewed, with a renewed warning about the need to use confirmatory techniques such as GLC-mass spectrometry (GLC-MS) to identify any uncertain FAs detected in higher plants.

Hairy roots were obtained directly from cotyledon leaves explants seven days after inoculation with the bacteria. The highest transformation efficiency was obtained from cotyledon leaves explants, and amounted to 53.3% within two weeks. Roots grew rapidly on solid growth regulator free 1/2 Murashige and Skoog medium and demonstrated characteristics of transformed roots such as fast growth and high lateral branching. Successful and stable transfer of rolB gene was illustrated by PCR using specific primers of the gene. The hairy roots showed an ability to synthesize natural and medicinal product, dopamine. Elicitation of dopamine production in P. oleracea hairy roots was tested using different concentrations of methyl jasmonate (0, 100, 150, 200 mu M) and salicylic acid (0, 125, 250, 500 mu M), added to the hairy root cultures during the late growth phase. The results showed that the various concentrations of the methyl jasmonate significantly increased the dopamine content, but, at concentration of 100 mu M, its impact was the most pronounced. Salicylic acid had no significant influence on dopamine production in hairy roots of P. oleracea. ", "Writer": "  By:Moghadam, YA (Moghadam, Y.

At harvest, 26 days after transplanting, apparent growth and biomass accumulation were not negatively affected by 6 to 10 mm added NaCl compared with 0 mm added NaCl. However, with the increase of added NaCl concentration from 0 to 6 to 10 mm, the sodium removal showed a 1- to 3-fold increase up to 0.26 to 0.41 mmol/plant, and 225.7 to 300.2 mmol-kg(-1) dry weight (DW) or 0.90 to 1.32 mmol.L-1 H2O, respectively. 'Green' produced greater biomass and removed more sodium per plant than 'Golden'. 'Golden' had more of a dwarfed and compact canopy than 'Green'. Sodium removal rate (mmol/plant/day) was the highest during the first 7 days after transplanting, but the fresh weight increase rate (g/plant/day) increased gradually as growth progressed. Results suggest that it is possible to hydroponically produce purslane in nutrient solutions with 8 to 12 nim Na+. Despite the high sodium-removal capability, purslane cannot be used to reduce Na+ concentrations in NaCl-rich hydroponic solutions. The biomass yield and the sodium removal of individual plants were affected by different cultivars and time after transplanting.

Among the species native to or naturalized in the Middle East, Christ's thorn jujube, purslane, rocket, jute mallow and safflower have considerable value because of their tolerance to salinity and harsh climatic conditions. These species have significant potential for future food and income security in the region. Similarly, salt-and drought-tolerant non-native species such as leaf mustard, quinoa, salicornia, guar, amaranth and New Zealand spinach, which showed good adaptation in field trials under harsh conditions in the United Arab Emirates, are likely to be of value in providing cost-effective and long-term solutions to problems of water shortage and increasing salinity of soil and water resources in the region. Besides their tolerance to abiotic stresses, all these species are nutritionally rich and can thus play a crucial role in combating vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies frequently experienced by inhabitants of marginal environments. Research to improve the productivity and value of these crops, and to encourage them to be more widely cultivated, would contribute to food, income and nutritional security in the Middle East, especially for smallholders living in marginal environments.

The present investigation was therefore conducted to evaluate heavy metal (cadmium, copper, lead and zinc) values in wild type and cultivated purslane, and soil samples collected in urban areas. Plant and soil samples were taken from two types of stations (brook coast and urban roadside) in two different districts (Bakirkoy and Zeytinburnu) of Istanbul. Standard procedures were used and the determinations of the elements in all samples were done using an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES). It was observed that washing procedure reduced concentrations of all heavy metals. As a result of the measurements, the heavy metal values of washed and unwashed plant samples varied as; Cd (0.270.36 mu g/g dw), Cu (9.64-17.63 mu g/g dw), Pb (4.51-9.62 mu g/g dw) and Zn (32.69-59.49 mu g/g dw) for wild type and cultivated purslane samples. Heavy metal accumulations in plants reflected soil values in a proportional way especially for Cd, Cu and Zn. According to the results of this study, it can be said that both types of purslane reflect heavy metal amounts well in different areas with their washed and unwashed samples.

Salt-tolerant crop variety development is of importance due to inadequate cultivable land and escalating salinity together with population pressure. In this view a total of 25 purslane accessions were initially selected from 45 collected purslane accessions based on better growth performance and subjected to 5 different salinity levels, that is, 0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 30.0, and 40.0 dSm(-1) NaCl. Plant height, number of leaves, number of flowers, and dry matter contents in salt treated purslane accessions were significantly reduced (P <= 0.05) and the enormity of reduction increased with increasing salinity stress. Based on dry matter yield reduction, among all 25 purslane accessions 2 accessions were graded as tolerant (Ac7 and Ac9), 6 accessions were moderately tolerant (Ac3, Ac5, Ac6, Ac10, Ac11, and Ac12), 5 accessions were moderately susceptible (Ac1, Ac2, Ac4, Ac8, and Ac13), and the remaining 12 accessions were susceptible to salinity stress and discarded from further study. The selected 13 purslane accessions could assist in the identification of superior genes for salt tolerance in purslane for improving its productivity and sustainable agricultural production.

Field studies were established to determine the efficacy of PRE applied saflufenacil + dimethenamid-P at six rates ranging from 10 + 88 to 319 + 2802 g ai ha(-1) on weed control and sweet corn tolerance on organic soils in the EAA in 2011 and 2012. Saflufenacil + dimethenamid-P is a premix recently labeled for PRE weed control in field corn at 50 + 438 to 90 + 788 g ha(-1) depending on soil texture. There was no phytotoxic effect of PRE applied saflufenacil + dimethenamid-P on sweet corn. At 42 d after treatment, common lambsquarters, common purslane, and spiny amaranth were controlled 90% with saflufenacil + dimethenamid-P at 58 + 508, 71 + 622, and 58 + 512 g ha(-1), respectively. Sweet corn yield at 95% of the weed-free yield was estimated to be obtained at 69 + 606 g ha(-1) of saflufenacil + dimethenamid-P. Our results show that saflufenacil + dimethenamid-P at 69 + 606 to 71 + 622 g ha(-1) controlled three common weeds and maintained acceptable sweet corn yield. Labeled rates of saflufenacil + dimethenamid-P for field corn on mineral soils were adequate for weed control in sweet corn on organic soils.

Purslane is widely distributed around the globe and is popular as a potherb in many areas of Europe, Asia, and the Mediterranean region. This plant possesses mucilaginous substances which are of medicinal importance. It is a rich source of potassium (494 mg/100 g) followed by magnesium (68 mg/100 g) and calcium (65 mg/100 g) and possesses the potential to be used as vegetable source of omega-3 fatty acid. It is very good source of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and gamma-linolenic acid (LNA, 18 : 3 w3) (4 mg/g fresh weight) of any green leafy vegetable. It contained the highest amount (22.2 mg and 130 mg per 100 g of fresh and dry weight, resp.) of alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid (26.6 mg and 506 mg per 100 g of fresh and dry weight, resp.). The oxalate content of purslane leaves was reported as 671-869 mg/100 g fresh weight. The antioxidant content and nutritional value of purslane are important for human consumption.

The samples (leaves, flowers and stems) were collected at two different locations in Portugal: Tavira (L1) and Vendas Novas (L2). Assays for total antioxidant activity, total phenolic content and ferric-reducing antioxidant power were conducted and, for both locations, significantly higher values (P<0,05) were observed for stems (508.8 and 982.3 mg AAE/100 g DW, 1008.6 and 2285.5 mg GAE/100 g DW, 121.0. and 166.3 mg TE/100 g DW, respectively for each location), than in leaves or flowers. In the DPPH assay, the three-plant parts from L2 reached the 50% inhibition rate in lower concentrations than plants from L1. On the other hand, higher concentrations of total monomeric anthocyanins were found in samples from L1 (95.5, 88.8 and 86.0 mg/L) than in samples from L2 (81.7, 70.5 and 59.8 mg/L). The same was true for phenolic acids, estimated by liquid-chromatography, where methanol extracts were used. Phenolic extracts from all three-plant parts from both locations showed protective effects on DNA against hydroxyl radicals. This work suggests the possibility of benefit to human health from its consumption, related to the high antioxidant activity of purslane, even the stems, usually discarded in daily consumption.

The objectives of this research were to understand the roles of soil temperature (daily average and fluctuation) and moisture on the emergence of nine winter annual weed species and dandelion and to develop predictive models for weed emergence based on the accumulation of modified thermal/hydrothermal time (mHTT). Experiments were established at Lincoln, NE; Mead, NE; and at two sites (irrigated and rainfed) near Clay Center, NE, in 2010 and 2011. In July of each year, 1,000 seeds of each species were planted in 15 by 20 by 6-cm mesh baskets installed between soybean rows. Soil temperature and water content were recorded at the 2-cm depth. Emerged seedlings were counted and removed from the baskets on a weekly basis until no additional emergence was observed in the fall, resumed in late winter, and continued until emergence ceased in late spring. Weather data were used to accumulate mHTT beginning on August 1. A Weibull function was selected to fit cumulative emergence (%) on cumulative mHTT (seven base temperature [T-base] by six base water potential [Psi(base)] by three base temperature fluctuation [F-base] candidate threshold values 5 126 models); it was also fit to days after August 1 (DAA1), for a total of 127 candidate models per species. The search for optimal base thresholds was based on the theoretic-model comparison approach (Akaike information criterion [AIC]). All three components (T-base, Psi(base), and F-base) were only important for Virginia pepperweed. For downy brome and purslane speedwell, including T-base and Psi(base) resulted in the best fit, whereas for dandelion including T-base and F-base resulted in the best fit. A model including only T-base resulted in the best fit for most species included in this study (Carolina foxtail, shepherd's-purse, pinnate tansymustard, henbit, and field pansy). For field pennycress, the model based on DAA1 resulted in the best fit. Threshold values were species specific. Soil temperature was the major environmental factor influencing winter annual weed emergence. Even though soil moisture and often temperature fluctuation are essential for seed germination, Psi(base) and F-base were not as critical in the predictive models as initially expected. Most seedlings (> 90%) of downy brome, pinnate tansymustard, Carolina foxtail, henbit, and field pansy emerged during the fall. Virginia pepperweed, purslane speedwell, dandelion, shepherd's-purse, and field pennycress seedlings emerged during both fall and spring. The results of this research provide robust information on the prediction of the time of winter annual weed emergence, which can help growers make better management decisions.

The green batavia 'Ganeria' was grown in a floating system in a autumn cycle. Three levels of aeration of the nutrient solution (high, low and no aeration) were tested. Two harvests were carried out; the first at 22 days after sowing (DAS) and the second after 27 DAS. The aerial part growth, nitrate and total phenols contents, antioxidant capacity and hue angle were measured in lettuce leaves at the harvesting day in both harvests. The differences among the levels of dissolved oxygen in nutrient solution were maintained between the two harvests. Regarding to aerial part growth, only significant differences between plant heights were found among aeration levels in both harvests. Nitrate and total phenols contents and antioxidant capacity were increased at the second harvest, but the hue angle value was maintained. Aeration significantly increased nitrate content and decreased total phenols content and antioxidant capacity at the first harvests. At second harvest only antioxidant capacity was affected, where the lowest value was found at the highest level of aeration. In conclusion, under conditions in which no aeration was provided, there was a slight decrease in plant growth, but the final quality of the product was improved because the content of functional phytochemicals were increased and nitrate content was decreased.

In order to study the effect of individual post-emergence application of 2,4-D plus MCPA and three sulfonylurea herbicides at four-to six-true leaf stage of weeds, experiments were conducted in 2011 at the greenhouse of Agricultural Faculty of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran. Treatments included untreated control and several rates of 2,4-D plus MCPA, foramsulfuron, nicosulfuron and nicosulfuron + rimsulfuron on redroot pigweed, common lambsquarters, common purslane and black nightshade. These herbicides were more effective to control redroot pigweed than other weeds (except nicosulfuron + rimsulfuron), thereupon minimum dose required for a satisfactory efficacy of 90% reduction of redroot pigweed aboveground dry matter (ED90) were 375.26, 23.51 and 63.81 g a.i h(-1) of 2,4-D plus MCPA, foramsulfuron and nicosulfuron, respectively. Nicosulfuron and nicosulfuron + rimsulfuron did not control common lambsquarters effectively. Foramsulfuron had the lowest effect on black nightshade and common purslane, so that minimum dose required for a 90% reduction of black nightshade and common purslane aboveground dry matter were 52.42 and 60.26 g a.i h(-1), respectively. Thus, these results showed that tank mixtures with other herbicides effective in controlling broadleaf weeds may be required for satisfactory weed control and reduction in sulfonylurea herbicides doses.

This work was performed in order to evaluate the antimicrobial activities of aqueous extracts from Portulaca oleracea L.. The MIC and MSC determinations combined with confocal laser scanning analysis were used to study the antimicrobial activities of aqueous extracts, against the common pathogens of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. The microorganisms were incubated on the biofilm-grown and planktonic stages, respectively. It was found that the extracts had the great potential inhibiting activities against all 3 microorganisms, with the MIC value of 0.25 %. As to these microorganisms, Staphylococcus aureus has the lowest MBC value (0.125 %). Further, the CLSM data reveal that the antimicrobial effects of the extracts are with the concentration- and time-dependent relationships, and there is no linear relationship between bacterial biofilm inhibition activities and concentration of the extracts. Therefore, the aqueous extracts from Portulaca oleracea L. might be considered as a potential antimicrobial agent.

However, no literature exists that examines the influence of traditional and novel GLVs on the liver fatty acid profile of an animal model genetically predisposed to developing hypertension. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of diets containing 4% collard greens, purslane or sweet potato greens on the liver fatty acid profiles of four-week old male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs, N = 44). Following four weeks consumption of the diets, liver fatty acid profiles were determined by gas-liquid chromatography of transesterified fatty acid methyl esters.  Results: SHRs consuming the control diet had greater percentages of liver saturated fatty acid and less omega-3 fatty acid percentages. SHRs consuming the diets containing vegetables had significantly greater liver concentrations of.-linolenic, docosahexaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids, as well as lower levels of lauric, palmitic and arachidonic acids. SHRs consuming the control diet had significantly greater percentages (p < 0.05) of oleic; significantly less.-linolenic and docosahexaenoic acids.  Conclusions: This study demonstrates the ability of GLVs to modulate liver fatty acid composition, thus providing protection against elevations in atherogenic fatty acids, which may be involved in CVD pathogenesis. Consequently, dietary recommendations for the prevention of CVD should consider the possible cardioprotective benefits and the subsequent alterations in fatty acid profiles afforded by diets containing collard greens, purslane and sweet potato greens.

Pathogenic fungal species were isolated and identified from naturally infected horse purslane. The biocontrol potential of these pathogens for horse purslane was evaluated by studying their host range and virulence under growth chamber and greenhouse conditions. Three candidates, Alternaria alternata, Fusarium oxysporum, and Phoma herbarum, were identified as potential candidates for biological control of horse purslane. Preliminary host-range tests and pathogenicity studies, conducted using 45 crop and weed plants belonging to 18 families, demonstrated that P. herbarum provided effective weed control and was safe to most of the plant species tested. Further mycoherbicidal application of P. herbarum as plant spray under field condition caused mortality of horse purslane 60 d after application of the inoculums. Phoma herbarum is a good mycoherbicide candidate against horse purslane.

In order to evaluate purslane herbal aqueous juice as a neuroprotective agent, the antioxidant activity of purslane juice was assessed in vitro and the neuroprotective effects of purslane (1.5 mL/Kg bwt) on rotenone (12 mg/Kg bwt for 12 days) induced biochemical changes and apoptosis in striatum of rats were also examined. The repeated administration of rotenone produced dramatic increases in intercellular content of calcium, dopamine metabolites and apoptosis in the striatum. In addition, rotenone administration caused significant decrease in complex I activity. These biochemical changes and apoptosis inductions were effectively counteracted by administration of purslane. Overall, the present study demonstrated the neuroprotective role of purslane in the striatum and proposes its prophylactic potential against developing brain damage and Parkinson's disease induction followed by rotenone administration, and that purslane may be considered as a potential neuroprotective agent against environmental factors affecting the function of the dopaminergic system.

The drying data were applied to nine different mathematical models, namely, the Newton, Page, Henderson and Pabis, Logarithmic, Wang and Singh, Diffusion Approach, Verma, Two -Term Exponential and the Midilli-Kucuk Equation Model. The performances of these models were compared based on the coefficient of determination (R-2), the standard error of estimate (SEE) and the residual sum of squares (RSS), between the observed and predicted moisture ratios. The MidilliKucuk model described the drying curve best in all drying methods (R-2 = 0.9996-1.0000, SEE = 0.0014-0.0208, RSS = 0.0001-0.0047).

The taro leaves showed the highest levels of ascorbic acid (198.33 mg 100 g(-1) fresh weight) and nitrogen (5.02 g 100 g(-1)), boron (0.0032 g 100 g(-1)), manganese (0.0069 g 100 g(-1)), in dry matter (DM). The leaves of ora-pro-nobis showed similar levels of ascorbic acid and the highest levels of phosphorus (0.45 g 100 g(-1)DM) and magnesium (0.68 g 100 g(-1)DM). In purslane leaves there were the highest iron (0.0324 g 100 g(-1)DM) and calcium (2.39 g 100 g(-1)DM) content. Concerning to zinc levels, the species that stood out were bertalha (0.0057 g 100 g(-1)DM) and ora-pro-nobis (0.0059 g 100 g(-1)DM). As for potassium, there was no significant difference amongst species (3.71 to 3.87 g 100 g(-1)DM). These species may become good sources of ascorbic acid and minerals with the spread of their use by the population.

The seedlings grown under full sun, partial (30% of full sun) and deep shade (10% of full sun) were analyzed by gas chromatography for fatty acid concentrations, and fed to rabbits with induced high serum cholesterol. The lower irradiances tended to increase concentrations of polar fraction fatty acids in leaves, including 18:3w3, an omega 3 fatty acid and 18:2w6. The relative proportion of fatty acids changed under low irradiance which also reduced the mole fraction of a number of saturated fatty acids, including 14:0, 23:0, 24:0 and 25:0. The experiments with rabbits, fed with a coconut oil rich diet to induce high blood cholesterol, indicated that Purslane rapidly decreased the high cholesterol concentration.

The effect of different ecological factors on germination of T. portulacastrum seeds collected in two different years (2009 and 2005) was studied in laboratory experiments. An increase in temperature from 25 to 35 degrees C increased germination percentage of T. portulacastrum from 65 to 85%, after which germination started to decrease, reducing to 71.25% at 45 degrees C. Trianthema portulacastrum had maximum germination with distilled water compared with different salt solutions and drought stress levels. Germination was significantly minimum at salinity and drought stress level of 250 mM and -0.8 MPa, respectively. Emergence of T. portulacastrum was maximum (86.25%) at 100% field capacity level but decreased sharply as field capacity decreased thereafter, and minimum emergence (30%) was recorded at field capacity level of 25%. Germination of T. portulacastrum was lowest at pH 5 and any increase in pH resulted in increased germination. A pH range of 8 to 10 had statistically similar germination. Sowing depth of 6 cm reduced the emergence of T. portulacastrum to zero. Reduction in emergence was recorded with depth increase from zero to 5 cm. Maximum emergence was recorded from soil surface (0 cm). An increase in temperature, salinity, drought, sowing depth (up to 4 cm) and a decrease in field capacity increased time to start germination/emergence, time to 50% germination/emergence and mean germination/emergence time but decreased germination/emergence index. Seeds collected during 2009 gave higher germination than old seeds collected in 2005. This information might contribute to development of effective control of T. portulacastrum.

Little published research exists evaluating herbicides that will control purslane and are also labeled for turfgrass. Thus, our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of preemergence (PRE) or postemergence (POST) herbicides labeled for use in turf for controlling purslane. Experiments were conducted once in 2011 and twice in 2012 to evaluate nine PRE herbicides at one-half maximum and maximum label rates applied over immature perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). The PRE herbicides isoxaben and simazine consistently resulted in the best purslane control for all three PRE experiments. Experiments in 2011 and 2012 evaluated 25 POST herbicides at full label rates applied to mature purslane plants. The POST herbicides fluroxypyr, triclopyr, and metsulfuron-methyl were most effective in controlling purslane.

Natural populations of mixed weed species were allowed to interfere with lettuce in a series of treatments of both increasing duration of weed interference and the duration of weed-free period imposed within 98, 196, and 293 kg P ha(-1) added to the soil. The beginning and end of the CPWC for each P fertilization level based on a 5% acceptable marketable fresh lettuce yield loss level was determined by fitting log-logistic and Gompertz models to represent the increasing duration of weed interference and the duration of weed-free period, respectively. The CPWC in lettuce was estimated to be 4.6, 3.4, and 2.3 wk at 98, 196, and 293 kg P ha(-1), respectively. The beginning of the CPWC was delayed at the highest P fertilization level (293 kg P ha(-1)), whereas the end of the CPWC was hastened at the same P fertilization level. Our study shows that inadequate levels of P fertilization in lettuce result in the need for more-intensive weed management practices to attain acceptable yields.

However, the potential anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects of Portulaca oleracea towards cancerous cells are still unclear. Human hormone dependent breast cancer MCF-7 cell, colon cancer HT-29, cervical cancer Hela cell and nasopharyngeal cancer CNE-1 cell were used in this study. P. oleracea was extracted using methanol and the cytotoxicity against various cancerous cell lines was evaluated using 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide solution (MTT) assay. The antiproliferation effect and cell cycle arrest were assessed using BrdU proliferation assay and flow cytometry cell cycle RNase/PI analysis, respectively. Portulaca oleracea methanol extract was able to reduce viability of all the tested cancerous cell lines. However, IC50 was only observed in CNE-1 cell (92 mu g/mL). BrdU incorporation assay indicated anti-proliferation of Portulaca oleracea treated MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. A significant increase in the sub G0/G1cell population phase observed by cell cycle analysis indicates the occurrence of apoptotic events. In conclusion, Portulaca oleracea showed anti-proliferative effect on CNE-1, HeLa and HT-29 and DNA fragmentation on MCF-7 cells.

Agaricus arvensis was immobilized on Amberlite XAD-4 and loaded onto a column. Important parameters such as pH and flow rate of the solution, amount of biosorbent and resin, volume of sample solution, which affect the efficiency of the preconcentration procedure for Pb and Al, were optimized. The effect of possible interfering ions, i.e., Cd2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Co2+, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Fe2+, was investigated. Experiments on the repeatability of the solid phase column showed that the same column could be used at least 30 cycles without loss of the biosorption efficiency for the recovery of Pb and Al.  The limit of detection (LOD) of Pb and Al was found to be 0.10 ng m(L-1) and 0.03 ng mL(-1), respectively. The sensitivity of ICP-OES improved 39.8-fold for Pb and 39.5-fold for Al. Linearity was obtained in the concentration range of 1.25-50.0 ng mL(-1) for Pb and 0.5-50.0 ng mL(-1) for Al. The relative standard deviation (RSD) of the method under optimum conditions was lower than 8.4% (n=5) for Pb and Al, which was validated through the analysis of certified reference tea and poplar leaves samples. The biosorption capacity of immobilized Agaricus arvensis for Pb and Al was found to be 31.2 mg g(-1) and 45.7 mg g(-1), respectively.  The developed method was applied to determine the concentrations of Pb and Al in various edible vegetable samples (cucumber, okra, tomato, beans, aubergine, watermelon, zucchini, pepper, melon, lettuce, roka, purslane, scallion, cress, parsley, cabbage, sugar cane, and basil) grown along the cultivated banks of the Tigris River in Diyarbakir, Turkey.

The optimal conditions for fatty acids extraction were obtained as follows: temperature 30.3 degrees C, extraction time 46 min and liquid/solid ratio 7.71 mL/g. Under these conditions the maximal value obtained for the oil extraction yield was 15.41 +/- 0.26%, which is in a good agreement with the predicted value of 15.36%. The oil analysis has also proved a good ratio between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, so purslane could be recommended as an alternative vegetal source for PUFAs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Pyroxasulfone was applied PRE at 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, and 1,000 g ai ha(-1) on soil with 80 % organic matter. Dose-response curves based on a three-parameter log-logistic model were used to determine pyroxasulfone rate required to provide 90 % control (ED90) of spiny amaranth, common lambsquarters, and common purslane in sweet corn. The ED90 values for spiny amaranth, common lambsquarters, and common purslane control were 209, 215, and 194 g ha(-1) of pyroxasulfone, respectively, at 21 d after treatment (DAT). At 42 DAT, the ED90 values for spiny amaranth, common lambsquarters, and common purslane control were 217, 271, and 234 g ha(-1) of pyroxasulfone, respectively. Sweet corn yield increased with increasing rates of pyroxasulfone. An estimated 214 g ha(-1) of pyroxasulfone was required to maintain sweet corn yield at 90 % level of the weed-free yield. In addition, pyroxasulfone did not result in sweet corn injury. These results indicate that pyroxasulfone can provide effective weed control in sweet corn on high-organic-matter soils of the EAA.

Salt stress can affect growth of crops as well as weeds. A study was conducted in a greenhouse to determine the effect of salinity (electrical conductivity [EC] of 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 dS m(-1)) on growth of barnyardgrass, horse purslane, junglerice, and rice. Growth variables were analyzed using regression analysis. The tested levels of EC influenced leaf production of barnyardgrass and junglerice but not that of horse purslane. As compared with the control treatment (EC of 1 dS m(-1)), shoot biomass of barnyardgrass decreased by only 24% at 12 dS m(-1), whereas rice biomass declined by 59% at this level of EC. At EC of 24 dS m(-1), barnyardgrass still produced 4% of the biomass of the control treatment, whereas rice did not survive at this level of EC. Junglerice shoot biomass decreased by 73% at 18 dS m(-1) EC compared with the control treatment, whereas rice shoot biomass declined by more than 86% at 18 dS m(-1) EC. An EC of 10 dS m(-1) was required to inhibit 50% shoot biomass of rice, whereas the EC to inhibit 50% shoot biomass of barnyardgrass and junglerice was 15 and 13 dS m(-1), respectively. Shoot biomass of horse purslane was not influenced by the tested levels of EC. At the highest EC (24 dS m(-1)), at which rice did not survive, horse purslane shoot biomass was similar to that of the control treatment. In all weed species, data for root biomass showed trends similar to those of shoot biomass. The results of this study suggest that weeds were more tolerant to salt than rice, and horse purslane was the most tolerant species among the weeds.

Sugarcane varieties were CP 89 - 2143, CP 88 - 1762, CP 80 - 1743, and CP 78 - 1628. Weed species were common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), spiny amaranth (Amaranthus spinosus L.), common purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.), sicklepod (Senna obtusifolia (L.) H.S. Irwin & Barneby), and coffee senna (Senna occidentalis (L.) Link). Adult residence was highest on coffee senna followed by spiny amaranth, sicklepod, and common purslane. Few adults were observed on sugarcane varieties and common lambsquarters. Adults caused feeding damage on all weed species. Coffee senna, spiny amaranth, and sicklepod had the highest feeding damage whereas common lambsquarters had the least damage. Little feeding damage was observed on sugarcane varieties. Oviposition of D. abbreviatus was observed on all sugarcane varieties and weed species with exception of common lambsquarters and sicklepod. Significantly more egg masses were found on sugarcane varieties compared with weed species. Weed surveys conducted in 3 locations in Florida sugarcane showed common lambsquarters, spiny amaranth, common purslane, and sicklepod as common broadleaf weeds in sugarcane fields. These results show that several weed species found in Florida sugarcane are suitable as food sources and oviposition sites for D. abbreviatus. However, sugarcane is generally more preferred for oviposition by D. abbreviatus. Preventing or removing weed hosts of D. abbreviatus from sugarcane fields will be an important defense against the weevil.

Molecular analysis was carried out using the ISSR technique with 10 primers, producing a total of 125 DNA bands, 80 of which were polymorphic among the accessions. A dendrogram drawn on the basis of a similarity matrix using the UPGMA algorithm revealed that the 70 samples of bladder campion plants could be classified into two major clusters at a Jaccard's genetic similarity index of 0.25, confirming that genetic variation was very high among and within accessions. An analysis of the morphological, agronomical and biochemical traits was a less efficient way of grouping the accessions due to the high inter-population variability observed for the analyzed traits used. Some accessions showed a very high level of nutritional compounds (glutathione, total phenols, and antioxidant capacity) and morphological characteristics, which, taken together, makes them attractive candidates for consumption as a ready-to-eat product. However, high concentrations of some anti-nutritional compounds (nitrates and oxalates) were found in some accessions. The results show sufficient variation exists in the desired traits within and among accessions in the germplasm to pursue a breeding programme to develop S. vulgaris cultivars as a high quality, minimally processed product.

In order to evaluate purslane herbal aqueous juice as a neuroprotective agent, we assessed the anti-apoptotic and antioxidant effects of purslane (1.5 ml/kg bwt) on rotenone (12 mg/kg bwt) induced brain injury in rats. Our results showed that purslane significantly decreased the number of apoptotic cells in the striatum. Immunohistochemical detection of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) showed that after purslane treatment there was an increase in cells stained positively for Bcl-2 and a decrease in the cells stained positively for NF-kappa B indicating the anti-apoptotic effect of purslane due its antioxidant activity. The elevation in reactive oxygen species, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, nitrite/nitrate and lactate dehydrogenase were all reduced with purslane treatment. Furthermore, PCR results for iNOS and caspase-3 genes showed down-regulation in purslane treated groups. Overall, our study emphasizes the pro-survival role of purslane in the midbrain and striatum and proposes its prophylactic potential against developing brain damage and neurodegenerative diseases associated with oxidative stress.

In this study, we evaluated the effect of salinity on total amounts of fatty acids (FAs) and omega 3/omega 6 ratio in leaves of purslane. Plants exposed to four levels of chloride salinity in the root zone (60, 90, 120 and 240 mM NaCl) for 40 days showed no signs of toxicity or death. The main FAs detected were C16:0 > C18:3 > C18:2. The ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 was not changed with salt stress. Hierarchic cluster analysis brought together 60 and 90 mM NaCl in control plants, based on their FA content. The results of this study confirm the purslane as a plant rich in FAs whose consumption may contribute to dietary intake of omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, with obvious benefits to human health.

Aqueous root, leaf and whole plant extracts of swine-cress were applied at 0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 and 10% (w/v). Results revealed significant inhibition of germination and seedling growth of wheat for all extract sources and concentrations. Variable phytotoxicity was exhibited by different extract sources and leaf extract caused the greatest inhibition. Nonetheless, the degree of inhibition increased in a concentration dependent manner for all extract sources. Compared to the control all treatments increased the time to 50% germination, and mean germination time, with corresponding decreases in germination index and final germination percentage of wheat. Higher (10%) concentration of root, leaf and whole plant extracts reduced final germination by 36, 59 and 39%, respectively. Leaf extract caused more inhibition of wheat shoot length, root length and dry biomass than other extracts. Wheat seedling dry biomass was inhibited 73% by leaf extract, 65% by whole plant extract and 12% by root extract at 10% concentration. All extracts reduced chlorophyll contents and increased phenolics in wheat seedlings. The results suggest that the inhibitory allelopathic activity of swine-cress against germination and seedling growth of wheat should be explored under field conditions.

These taxa were identified as the microspecies Portulaca nitida, Portulaca oleracea, Portulaca rausii and Portulaca granulatostellulata. Morphological characters did not provide a clear distinction among the four taxa of P. oleracea s.l. It was found that mixed populations of the taxa occur in several locations and morphological similarities between the microspecies were detected. ISSR analysis indicates that gene flow among populations of different taxa was high and most of the genetic variation (61.9%) occurs within population. These results are inconsistent with the general characteristics of P. oleracea as a self- or 5% cross-pollinated species. A close relationship between P. oleracea, P. rausii and P. granulatostellulata was supported by ISSR and 18S rDNA gene sequence. The ISSR and 18s data support the specific status of P. nitida as a recently evolved taxon. We conclude that P. oleracea exists as a polymorphic species and is not divisible into microspecies based on seed surface as the primary morphological trait, and inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) and 18S rDNA gene sequence markers. We suggest that the taxa do not merit specific rank as morphological characters and absence of a breeding barrier fail to separate the different populations when they become sympatric.

The levels of these lipids per 100 g fresh weight were quantified as follows: 6.52 +/- 0.44 mg phytosterols, 9.05 +/- 0.04 mg alpha-tocopherol and 115.0 +/- 2.0 mu g squalene. Argentation thin layer chromatography further resolved the phytosterol isolate into beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol and campesterol, the identities of which were established through melting point determination coupled with ultraviolet and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Furthermore, gas chromatographic analysis of purslane oil revealed the presence of the omega-3 fatty acids alpha-linolenic acid and docosahexaenoic acid at 17.00 +/- 0.33% and 5.08 +/- 0.49%, respectively, of purslane oil. A new semi-quantitative in vivo duck embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay for angiogenesis was described in this study including a scoring system with a scale of -3 to +3, with -3 as the score for complete loss of blood capillaries. Purslane oil and its saponifiable and unsaponifiable fractions exhibited scores of -1 to -2.7 when applied to CAM at 150-300 mu g. Their anti-angiogenic activity can be attributed to the presence of phytosterols, alpha-tocopherol, squalene and omega-3 fatty acids. This study revealed the potential use of purslane in modulating angiogenesis.

Field experiments were conducted from 2005 to 2009 to evaluate oxyfluorfen efficacy on common purslane and prostrate pigweed and green onion tolerance when applied POST at 0, 30, 70, 105, and 290 g ai ha(-1) approximately 3 wk after planting. No crop injury was observed from any of the herbicide rates, except in 2009 when 209 g ha(-1) oxyfluorfen resulted in 10% injury at 7 d after treatment. The transient injury did not reduce green onion yield. Green onion yield ranged from 1.8 to 2.2 kg plot(-1) in 2006 and 1.3 to 1.5 kg plot(-1) in 2009. In 2007 yield increased linearly from 1.9 to 3.0 kg plot(-1) with oxyfluorfen rates of 0 to 105 g ha(-1). Common purslane control increased as the rate of oxyfluorfen increased. Application of oxyfluorfen at 70 to 105 g ha(-1) provided the best control of common purslane, ranging from 61 to 95% across the years. Similar control results were observed for prostrate pigweed. Prostrate pigweed control with 70 to 105 g ha(-1) ranged from 40 to 93% from 2005 to 2009. These results suggest that green onion tolerates oxyfluorfen rates of 70 to 105 g ha(-1), and these rates provide common purslane and prostrate pigweed control that growers would find acceptable. Registration of the water-based formulation of oxyfluorfen would provide growers an opportunity to control weeds and reduce the need for hand labor.

Recommendations regarding commonly used tools for weed management could benefit this sector of agriculture. The objectives of this research were to (1) determine the optimum time of day for propane flaming to achieve maximum weed reductions while minimizing corn damage; (2) assess whether flaming, rotary hoeing, or a combination of the two tools best manages early-season weeds without injuring dry beans; and (3) evaluate the use of growing degree days (GDD) to optimize rotary hoe timing. Experiments were carried out between 2006 and 2009 in Hickory Corners and East Lansing, MI. Flaming reduced broadleaf weed densities by at least 82% when done in the morning to midafternoon but only reduced densities by 58% when weeds were flamed in the evening. Common lambsquarters, redroot pigweed, and velvetleaf were easier to control by flaming than common ragweed and common purslane. Flaming did not reduce grass weed densities. When comparing flaming and rotary hoeing, the two treatments that achieved the highest level of weed control and highest dry bean yields were flaming prior to bean emergence followed by two rotary hoeings and rotary hoeing three times (no flaming). However, the added cost of the flamer may only be justified when wet conditions make rotary hoeing ineffective. Flaming dry beans POST resulted in significant injury and yield reductions of 60%; therefore this practice is not recommended. Timing rotary hoe passes every 300 GDD (base 3.3 C) from the time of soybean or dry bean planting resulted in fewer passes compared with the 7-d or 150 GDD treatments, while maintaining similar levels of weed control and yields similar to the weed-free treatment in 1 of 2 yr for each crop.

Cucumbers were the most sensitive of the cucurbit crops to fomesafen and produced little or no fruit in two out of three experiments when applied at 0.28 kg ai ha(-1). Fomesafen also reduced cantaloupe yield. Visual damage was noted on the other crops tested, but crop yield was not impacted by fomesafen at 0.28 -0.35 kg ai ha(-1). With the exception of cucumbers, injury caused by fomesafen to cucurbit crops was transitory even when fomesafen-treated soil splashed onto the leaves of emerging cucurbits during a powerful thunderstorm at one of the test sites. Control of redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), Powell amaranth (Amaranthus powellii) and other Amaranthus spp., lambsquarters (Chenopodium album), hairy nightshade (Solanum physafolium), common purslane (Portulaca oleraceae), and velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrastii) ranged from 92 to 100% with fomesafen applied at 0.28 kg ai ha(-1). The excellent efficacy on these difficult to control weed species suggests that lower rates of fomesafen may be appropriate and improve crop tolerance, particularly if fomesafen is tankmix-applied with other preemergence herbicides such as s-metolachlor or dimethenamid-p. Weed control with these combinations was excellent for all weed species in these experiments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The concentrations of metals were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical spectrometry (ICP-OES). Critical parameters, such as the pH of the solution, flow rate, the amount of biosorbent, type and volume of eluent, and the sample volume, that affect the solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure were optimized. The optimum extraction conditions were determined as being a pH of 6.0 for Cd2+ and of 5.0 for Co2+; a sample flow rate of 2.0 mL min(-1); 200.0 mg of biosorbent; and 5.0 mL of 1.0 mol L-1 HCl as eluent. The capacities of the biosorbent for metal uptake were found to be 11.3 and 9.8 mg g(-1) for Cd2+ and Co2+ ions, respectively. Limit of quantitations (LOQs) were found to be 0.67 and 0.82 ng mL(-1), respectively, for Cd2+ and Co2+. The linear working curves were observed to be in the linear range from 1.0 to 50.0 ng mL(-1), and possessed high correlation coefficients. The use of the SPE method showed 50.7- and 35.7-fold improvements in the sensitivities of ICP-OES. The developed method was successfully applied to NCS ZC-73014 (a certified reference tea sample). Relative standard deviations (RSD) were lower than 5.0%. The Cd2+ and Co2+ concentrations in the different parts (leave, root, stem, and fruit) of purslane, onion, rocket, okra, and aubergine were determined after microwave digestion and solid-phase extraction by P. eryngii immobilized on Amberlite XAD-16.

The antioxidant activity was measured using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. The iodine titration method was used to determine the ascorbic acid content (AAC). DPPH scavenging (IC50) capacity ranged from 1.30 +/- 0.04 to 1.71 +/- 0.04 mg/mL, while the ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant activity (AEAC) values were 229.5 +/- 7.9 to 319.3 +/- 8.7 mg AA/100 g, total phenol content (TPC) varied from 174.5 +/- 8.5 to 348.5 +/- 7.9 mg GAE/100 g. AAC 60.5 +/- 2.1 to 86.5 +/- 3.9 mg/100 g and FRAP 1.8 +/- 0.1 to 4.3 +/- 0.1 mg GAE/g. There was good correlation between the results of TPC and AEAC, and between IC50 and FRAP assays (r(2) > 0.9). The concentrations of Ca, Mg, K, Fe and Zn increased with plant maturity.

The primary objective of this research was to assess the effects of strip tillage, compost, and carrot cultivar on carrot quality, yield, and profitability. An important secondary objective was to evaluate the impact of tillage and compost on establishment of important weeds in carrot systems-including two species that have developed resistance to linuron: Powell amaranth (Amaranthus powellii) and common purslane (Portulaca oleracea). Field experiments were conducted in 2009 and 2010 comparing conventional tillage (CT) to strip tillage (ST) under two rates of mature compost addition (0 or 3 dry t.ha(-1)) for three processing carrot varieties ('Canada', 'Finley', and 'Recoleta'). In the ST system, a pre-established barley cover crop was left to grow as a windbreak between crop rows until carrots were established. Partial budget analysis was used to estimate net returns associated with all treatments. Compared with CT, the ST system resulted in 1) either equivalent or greater (2010, Finley cultivar) total carrot yields and net returns; and 2) either equivalent or lower summer annual weed densities. Addition of compost resulted in equivalent (2010) or higher (2009) carrot yields and gross returns but did not affect net returns as a result of the increased costs associated with compost application. Compost reduced the density of common purslane in 2009 but resulted in a threefold increase in the density of Powell amaranth in 2010. Our results demonstrate that both ST and compost applications are potentially valuable tools for improving the profitability of carrot production systems. Future research examining the mechanistic basis for compost and tillage effects on carrots and weeds as well as the long-term effects of these practices on profitability of rotational crops would be helpful for optimizing their use in vegetable production systems.

Inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy and proximate analysis of the edible portion of mature plants revealed higher mineral, protein, fat, and fiber contents compared to common leafy vegetables like cabbage and lettuce. Gas chromatographic analysis of the oil extract revealed 17.00 +/- 0.33% and 5.08 +/- 0.49% of the omega-3 fatty acids alpha-linolenic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, respectively. Phytosterols, alpha-tocopherol, and squalene were also quantified at 6.52 +/- 0.44 mg, 9.05 +/- 0.04 mg, and 115.0 +/- 2.0 mu g per 100 g fresh weight, respectively. The major phytosterols were then isolated and quantified using argentation thin layer chomatography. beta-sitosterol was identified as the dominant sterol component. An in vivo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, which utilized the highly vascularized CAM as biological test surface, was done to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of purslane. Purslane oil and its saponifiable and unsaponifiable fractions exhibited 44-99% inhibition of the irritation caused by sodium dodecyl sulfate when applied to CAM at 15-150 mu g. The anti-inflammatory activity of purslane can be attributed to the presence of the aforementioned phytochemicals. This information is vital to promote the plant as a functional food. As a functional food, it should contain physiologically active components that provide health benefits beyond basic nutrition.

Male kunming mice (5-weeks-old, 24 g) were used in this experiment. After a 4-day adaptation period, animals were randomly divided into four groups (n = 10 in each group); Group 1: animals received normal powdered rodent diet; Group 2: animals received high fat diet; Groups 3 and 4: animals received high fat diet and were fed by gavage to mice once a day with aqueous extract at the doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight, respectively. In mice fed with high-fat diet, blood and liver lipid peroxidation level was significantly increased, whereas antioxidant enzymes activities were markedly decreased compared to normal control mice. Administration of an aqueous extract of P. oleracea L. significantly dose-dependently reduced levels of blood and liver lipid peroxidation and increased the activities of blood and liver antioxidant enzymes activities in high fat mice. Moreover, administration of an aqueous extract of P. oleracea L. significantly dose-dependently increase liver Leptin/beta-actin (B), and Liver PPAR alpha/beta-actin, decrease liver, spleen FAS mRNA, p-PERK and p-PERK/PERK protein expression levels. Taken together, these data demonstrate that aqueous extract of P. oleracea L. can markedly alleviate high fat diet-induced oxidative injury by enhancing blood and liver antioxidant enzyme activities, modulating Leptin/beta-actin (B), and Liver PPAR alpha/beta-actin, decrease liver, spleen FAS mRNA, p-PERK and p-PERK/PERK protein expression levels in mice.

Since BOA detoxification by metabolic alteration may influence the relation between the benzoxazinoid content of the soil mulch and weed suppression, we tested the dynamics in BOA detoxification in different plant organs of three and 10-day-old seedlings of four warm season weeds incubated with five BOA concentrations (4, 20, 40, 80, and 200 mu mol g(-1) fresh weight). In addition, germination and length of 3-day-old seedlings were measured after exposure to 0, 0.3, 1.5, 3, 6, and 15 mu mol BOA. Finally, we tested the influence of the MDR translocator inhibitors verapamil, nifedipine, and the GST inhibitor ethycrynic acid on BOA accumulation and detoxification activity. Due to BOA-detoxification, all weeds were able to grow in environments with low BOA contents. At higher contents, Abutilon theophrasti and Chenopodium album had a better chance to survive because of highly active mechanisms that avoided the uptake of BOA (A. theophrasti) and of efficient detoxification activities in youngest seedlings (C. album). The interpretation of all of the data gave the following sequence of increasing sensitivity: A. theophrasti <<< C. album << P. oleracea a parts per thousand currency sign A. retroflexus. The results were in agreement with recent findings of the suppression of these weeds by rye mulches and their benzoxazinoid contents. Our studies demonstrate for the first time that the detoxification of BOA influences the survival of certain weeds in environments enriched with this allelochemical. Therefore, detoxification processes affect the potential for weed suppression by soil allelochemicals in sustainable weed management.

Due to its novel nature and potentially interesting chemistry, the American native, Sunflower (Helianthus annuus), was tested for its ability to suppress Horse purslane growth and its feasibility for use in weed control strategies. Aqueous extract of sunflower significantly inhibited seed germination, seedling growth and dry matter accumulation of T. portulacastrum in laboratory bioassays at concentrations of 5, 10 and 15% (w/v). In pot trials, sunflower rhizosphere soil (SRSS), at the stage of 60 days after sunflower sowing (DAS), inhibited above 50% of growth and yield attributes of T. portulacastrum. Extract fractionation showed the highest phytotoxicity against shoot and root growth of test weeds at 100 ppm. Several phenolic acids were identified in stem and leaf extracts through paper chromatography. Their identity was confirmed through spraying with diazotized-p-nitro aniline, sufanilic acid, ferric chloride-potassium ferricyanide and also tested with Hoepfner'scoplin reaction. These results suggest that sunflower is an important potential source of compounds for control of horse purslane in kharif crops. ", "Writer": "  By:Rawat, LS (Rawat, L.

A randomized complete block design was employed with four replicates per treatment with each organic amendment used at half (x/2), single (x=10 t ha(-1)) and double (2x) rates (organic fertilization: cow manure, poultry manure and barley mulch; synthetic fertilizer (240 kg N ha(-1): 21-0-0); and control). The highest number and dry weight of weeds were recorded for double cow manure and chemical fertilizer treatments. The cow manure treatments promoted weed emergence and growth proportionally to the rate of application (x/2<x<2x). In the presence of barley residues, weed biomass or density was reduced for the species: redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), common purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.) and prostrate knotweed (Polygonum aviculare L.). Weed suppressive effect of barley residues decreased with time following residue decomposition. The barley mulch plots presented the highest values of Shannon-Weiner and Simpson indices. These results indicate that green manure of barley are effective for the suppression of some weeds in sweet maize.

Adult male Wister albino rats were orally treated with Portulaca oleracea (purslane) at a dose of 1.5 mL/kg body weight for 12 days. Pre-treatment, post-treatment and co-treatment of rotenone (12 mg/kg body weight) was given orally. The striatum level of Na+/K+-ATPase activity, glutathione (GSH), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were evaluated. Protein carbonyl and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels were also determined. Results revealed that purslane administration induced a marked improvement in all the parameters that were studied. Purslane reversed the increases in protein carbonyl and H2O2 that were a consequence of the oxidative stress generated by rotenone administration. Additionally, RT-PCR results showed that whilst GPx transcription was decreased due to rotenone administration, it was up-regulated with purslane treatment. In conclusion, the present study provided a clear evidence that purslane possesses promising activity against rotenone-induced neurodegeneration. Thus, it may be useful against neurotoxicity induced by environmental neurotoxins. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Weeds evaluated were Amaranthus retroflexus (redroot pigweed), Cyperus esculentus (yellow nutsedge), Eleusine indica (goosegrass), Portulaca oleracea (common purslane), and Solanum americanum (American black nightshade). Additionally, although it is recommended as a cover crop in southern regions of the U. S., Aeschynomene americana (American jointvetch) was evaluated as a weed following the detection of root galling in a heavy volunteer infestation of an experimental field in southeastern Florida. Weeds were propagated from seed and inoculated with 1000 nematode eggs when plants reached the two true-leaf stage. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum 'Rutgers') was included as a positive control. Aeschynomene americana and P. oleracea roots supported the highest number of juveniles (J2) and had the highest number of eggs/g of root for all three species of Meloidogyne tested. However, though P. oleracea supported very high root levels of the three nematode species tested, its fleshy roots did not exhibit severe gall symptoms. Low levels of apparent galling, combined with high egg production, increase the potential for P. oleracea to support populations of these three species of root-knot nematodes to a degree that may not be appropriately recognized. This research quantifies the impact of P. oleracea as a host for M. arenaria, M. incognita, and M. javanica compared to several other important weeds commonly found in Florida agricultural production, and the potential for A. americana to serve as an important weed host of the three species of root-knot nematode tested in southern regions of Florida.

A total of 304 field vegetable samples composed of parsley, spearmint, scallion, basil, coriander, dill, cress, leek, tarragon, radish and purslane were purchased from the vegetable markets. Each sample was divided into three groups. One group was used as the unwashed sample and the second and third groups were washed with traditional and standard washing procedures, respectively. Intestinal parasites were detected in 32.6% of unwashed, 1.3% of traditionally washed and not in any standard washed samples (P < 0.001). The parasites were detected in unwashed vegetable samples included Ascaris lumbricoides eggs (14.1%). Taeniid spp. eggs (9.2%), Toxocara spp. eggs (3.3%), Trichostrongylus spp. eggs (4.3%), Giardia spp. cysts (8.2%) and non-pathogenic protozoan Entamoeba coli cysts (9.2%). The rate of parasitic contamination in different seasons was found to be 55% in spring, 45.5% in summer, 14.9% in autumn and 12.3% in winter (P < 0.005). The results highlight the potential of unwashed raw vegetables in transmission of intestinal parasites to human, and also emphasize the use of standard washing procedure (proper washing and disinfecting) before consumption of vegetables instead of traditional procedure (quick washing without disinfecting).

Aqueous extracts of wheat straw were prepared by soaking the wheat straw in distilled water in 1: 10 w/v ratio and diluted to obtain the concentrations of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100%. These were used as pre and post emergence in laboratory and screen house trials. Wheat aqueous extracts exhibited phytotoxicity to horse purslane by inhibiting and delaying its germination and suppressing seedling growth. Wheat phytotoxins in its aqueous extracts suppressed the chlorophyll content and soluble protein, and enhanced soluble phenolics and the activity of antioxidant enzymes as catalase, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase in the seedlings of horse purslane compared with the control. Such inhibitory activity is believed to originate from exposure to wheat phytotoxins that are present in its aqueous straw extract. The suppressive effects of wheat straw need to be investigated further under field conditions.

All solarization treatments suppressed winter and summer weeds with no significant difference among the plastic materials, although biodegradable film was less efficient in controlling common purslane and common amaranth. Weed infestation at the harvest of both lettuce cultivars was not affected by the solarizing material, whereas fewer weeds were found in the plots grown with 'Bacio' than with 'Moringa'. Lettuce yield in two successive growing seasons was always significantly higher in solarized plots than in nontreated control, without any statistical difference among the plastic materials. Yield and head quality of cv. 'Bacio' were higher than 'Moringa' in the first growing season, but the opposite occurred in the second crop. Soil solarization was confirmed to be effective for weed management in field lettuce crops in the Mediterranean areas, although weed suppression may be affected also by the lettuce cultivar. Choice of solarizing materials, when similarly effective on weeds and crop yield, should take into account also their cost. Low density polyethylene plastics emerged as the best choice in conventional lettuce crops as highly effective as, and less expensive than the other materials, whereas the use of biodegradable films should be limited to organic lettuce systems.

Nutrients were supplied as a modified full-strength Hoagland solution two to three times weekly. Plants were harvested sequentially at 20, 40, and 60 days after transplanting (DAT) corresponding to 42, 63, and 84 days after sowing. Fatty acids were determined using a gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Harvest intervals significantly influenced foliage fresh and dry weight, leaf number and plant height, and root length and fresh weight and were greatest at 60 DAT. Fatty acid analysis verified the presence of myristate, palmitate, linoleate, and linolenate at 20 DAT and in all three harvests, whereas stearate and oleate were detected only in the last two harvests (40 and 60 DAT). Linoleate, palminate, and linolenate were the most abundant fatty acids in purslane with levels in excess of 300 mg.kg(-1). Those for myristate, stearate, and oleate were in excess of 200 mg.kg(-1). The ratio of omega-6/omega-3 ranged from 0.44 for Harvest 1 to 1.1 for Harvest 3, whereas ratios for harvest intervals two and three were equal to or greater than the recommended daily human requirement. Results showed qualitative and quantitative differences of harvest intervals of purslane, suggesting that an optimal ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids can be achieved approximate to 20 DAT.

Cores and sediment samples were collected from two tidal creek banks, covered by Atriplex portulacoides (Sea Purslane) and Juncus maritimus (Sea Rush), respectively. The objectives of the study were to examine the variation of sediment stability throughout banks with cantilevers present and investigate the influence of roots and downcore consolidation on bank stability. Data on erosion threshold and shear strength were interpreted with reference to bank depth, sediment properties and biological influences. The higher average erosion threshold was from the Sea Purslane bank whilst the Sea Rush bank showed higher average vane shear strength. The vertical variation in core sediment stability was mainly affected by roots and downcore consolidation with depth. The data obtained from the bank faces revealed that vertical variations in both erosion threshold and vane shear strength were affected primarily by roots and algae. A quantitative estimate of the relative contributions of roots and downcore consolidation to bank sediment stability was undertaken using the bank stability data and sediment density data. This showed that roots contributed more to the Sea Purslane bank stability than downcore consolidation, whilst downcore consolidation has more pronounced effects on the Sea Rush bank stability.

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of Purslane and Lovastatin therapy in decreasing serum lipids, lipoproteins, and paraoxanase1 (PON1) activity. In this clinical trial study, 93 patients with LDL-C more than 120 mg/dl who referred to the internal clinic of Kashani hospital in Sahrekord, Iran were selected and divided into two groups: Purslane (42 patients) and Lovastatin (51 patients). Fasting venous blood samples obtained before and 45 days after taking Purslane or Lovastatin, levels of all variables in the samples were measured. Our results showed that after receiving Purslane or Lovastatin serum level of cholesterol, LDL-C and OxLDL decreased. PON1 activity, ApoA1 and HDL-C increased but Triglyceride and body mass index (BMI) decreased Only in Purslane group. ApoB decreased only after taking Lovastatin.

Although it is grow as a weed plant in field, it is cultivated in wide range in south part of Iran. Purslane is important in respect to unsaturated fatty acids and high nutritive value. For determining fatty acids, oxalic acid and mineral elements (K, Mg, Ca, Fe) of Iranian purslane cultivars, this research was carried out. Cultivars 'Behbahan', 'Ahwaz', 'Borazjan' and 'Tehran' were planted in greenhouse. Determination of fatty acid by gas chromatography showed that linolenic acid (omega-3) of leaf and seed were 19.69-30.15% and 19.42-29.81%, respectively. Oxalic acid content of leaf cultivars was over the range 40-80 g per 100 g fresh weight and the lowest amount was determined in cultivar 'Borazjan'. Dry matter content of leaf varied from 4.25 to 4.71%. Cultivar 'Borazjan' had the highest potassium and calcium and iron content of cultivar 'Behbahan' was higher than other cultivars. Among mineral elements, magnesium content of cultivar 'Tehran' was 84.78 mg per 100 g fresh weight. Mean of potassium, magnesium, calcium and iron of Iranian purslane was 500, 66, 154 and 31 mg per 100 g fresh weights, respectively. This research showed that Iranian purslane cultivars are a rich source of omega-3 fatty acid, mineral elements and have lower oxalic acid content and are recommended for human nutrition. "}

(sea purslane) growing in a micro-tidal salt marsh in the Mont-Saint-Michel Bay in France. This new species is the first member of Meloidoderita Poghossian, 1966 collected from a saline environment, and is characterized by the following features: sedentary mature females having a small swollen body with a clear posterior protuberance; slightly dorsally curved stylet, 19.9 mu m long, with posteriorly sloping knobs; neck region irregular in shape and twisted; well developed secretory-excretory (S-E) pore, with markedly sclerotized S-E duct running posteriorly; prominent uterus bordered by a thick hyaline wall and filled with eggs. The adult female transforms into a cystoid. Eggs are deposited in both egg-mass and cystoid. Cystoids of Meloidoderita salina sp. n. display a unique sub-cuticular hexagonal beaded pattern.  Male without stylet, pharyngeal region degenerated, S-E duct prominent, deirids small, developed testis 97.5 mu m long, spicules 18.4 mu m long, cloacal opening ventrally protruded, small phasmids posterior to cloaca opening and situated at 5.9 (3.2-7.7) mu m from tail end, and conical tail ending in a rounded terminus marked with one (rarely two) ventrally positioned mucro. Additionally, some young males of the new species were observed enveloped in the last J2 cuticle. Second-stage juvenile body 470 mu m long, with a 16.4 mu m long stylet, prominent rounded knobs set off from the shaft, hemizonid anterior and adjacent to S-E pore, small deirids located just above S-E pore level, genital primordium located at 68-77% of body length, phasmids small and located at about 19 mu m from tail tip, and tail 38.7 mu m long, tapering to finely pointed terminus with a finger-like projection. Phylogenetic analyses based on the nearly full length small subunit ribosomal DNA sequences of Meloidoderita salina sp. n. revealed a close relationship of the new species with Sphaeronema alni Turkina & Chizhov, 1986 and placed these two species sister to the rest of Criconematina.

A field experiment was conducted to determine the effects of herbicides and mulching on weed flora, growth and yield of a leek crop. A randomized complete block design was employed with five replicates per treatment (control, mulching with barley straw, post-transplant application of the herbicide oxyfluorfen at 360 g a.i./ha and pre-transplant application of pendimethalin at 1,650 g a.i./ha). The order of weed sensitivity to mulches was black nightshade (72-85%), venice mallow (80%) > redroot pigweed (70-74%), barnyardgrass (67-77%) > jimsonweed (65%) > common purslane (42-45%). Oxyfluorfen had the highest control of jimsonweed, venice mallow and common purslane. There were no significant effects of the pendimethalin treatment on weed control ratings of jimsonweed, venice mallow and field bindweed. Injury symptoms (small white spots) appeared on leek leaves exposed to oxyfluorfen. The highest yield of leek was recorded with the oxyfluorfen application. Our results indicate that mulching and oxyfluorfen application provides satisfactory control of weeds. The use of mulching is an option for the weed management in organic leek crop.

Both were grown in a floating system over four crop cycles. Our results showed purslane to be a crop that exhibited little sensitivity to oxygen depletion in the rooting medium, since it was able to adapt to a gradual reduction in oxygen content. Under such conditions, purslane plants created an aerenchyma tissue (equivalent to approx. 10% of root sections in the non-aerated treatments in both cultivars) that helped to maintain growth. Under conditions in which no aeration was provided, there was a slight decrease in plant growth. The final quality of the product was improved because leaf nitrate concentrations were reduced (by more than 1,300 mg kg(-1) FW) compared with the high aeration treatment, and the content of functional phytochemicals and SPAD values (chlorophyll contents) were increased.

The antibacterial activities of EtOH extract of E. supina and its n-hexane, EtOAc, n-butanol and water fractions were evaluated against 6 strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and 1 standard methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) strain by using the disc diffusion method, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and colorimetric assay using 3- 4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) test under dark and light intensity from 2,000 to 18,000 lux. Under dark, the n-hexane fraction of E. supina had a MIC of 31.25 mu g/ml. Antimicrobial activity of all the fractions was remarkable especially under illumination from 14,000 to 16,000 lux. E. supine can be considered an alternative MRSA treatment.

In this study, we evaluated the allelopathic effects of seed, stem and root aqueous extract of Galbanum in three concentrations (10, 5 and 2.5%) on seed germination and seedling growth of three weeds (common amaranth, purslane and wild barley) with pre and post-emergence method. In pre-emergence experiment, bioassays showed that all organ extracts in most of the concentrations significantly decreased germination percent, germination rate, radicle length and hypocotyl length. In post-emergence method, root (except wild barley) and stem length, dry and wet weight decreased in most of the treatment, viability reduced in some treatment of receiver plant. Also, total protein root content of wild barley plantlet enhanced by exposing them to stem extract (after 48 h), but polyphenol and peroxidase enzyme activity decreased. This study exhibited that galbanum has inhibitor material that decreased seed germination and seedling growth of receiver weeds. So, galbanum is an allelopathic plant that can be considered as a source of allelochemical. Also, galbanum organs can be used as an organic herbicide. Further, one of the main reasons for the hard dormancy of galbanum is the presence of the inhibitor compound.

It can reproduce vegetatively from stem cuttings by forming adventitious roots from the cut end of the stem. Apart from large stem cuttings, it is unclear whether purslane cuttings of various plant tissues differ in their ability to reproduce asexually. The objective of the study was to determine the survival and asexual reproductive capacity of purslane cuttings. A greenhouse study evaluated three cuttings from two stem locations and a leaf from one stem location for their survival and new leaf growth after 21 d. Cuttings included a stem node with either leaves attached or removed and a stem internode, all from proximal and distal stem locations relative to the root crown, and a leaf from a proximal stem node. Stem node cuttings had >= 70% survival, whereas internodes had 0% survival. Nodes with leaves attached further increased survival by > 20%. The location of the cutting on the main stem did not affect survival. Only noded cuttings produced new leaves, and cuttings with leaves attached produced the most new leaves. For purslane to vegetatively reproduce, nodes on stem cuttings are required, and the presence of leaves on the cutting improves the survival and new leaf growth of cuttings. Therefore, mechanical methods of weed control that chop and spread purslane leaves and stems might not be effective and could ultimately increase weed populations.

Experiments were conducted to determine the influence of various environmental factors on seed germination and seedling emergence of two populations of horse purslane. Seeds were collected from rice fields of the International Rice Research Institute (the IR population) and from sorghum fields of the University of the Philippines (the UP population); the two sites were 5 km apart in Los Banos, Philippines. Germination response of both populations was greater at 30/20 C and 35/25 C day/night temperatures than they were at 25/15 C alternating day/night temperatures. Germination of both populations was greater in the light/dark regime than in darkness. In dark, depending on the temperature, seed germination of the UP population ranged from 37 to 62%, whereas seed germination of the IR population was < 20%. Exposure to 5 min at 117 and 119 C for the IR and UP populations, respectively, reduced germination to 50% of maximum germination. Osmotic potential of -0.26 MPa inhibited germination to 50% of the maximum for the UP population, whereas the corresponding value for the IR population was -0.37 MPa. Seeds placed on or near the soil surface had maximum emergence, and emergence declined with increase in seed burial depth. Seedling emergence of the UP and IR populations was 74% and 13%, respectively, for seeds placed on the soil surface. For both populations, no seedlings emerged from a soil burial depth of 6 cm or more. Germination and emergence responses to light and seed burial depth differed between the two populations of horse purslane. Residues on the soil surface of up to 6 Mg ha(-1) did not influence seedling emergence of either populations. Knowledge gained in this study could contribute to developing components of integrated weed management strategies for horse purslane.

Materials and methods: A thirty subject with type-2 diabetes divided into two groups, to receive 5g of PO seeds twice daily while in the second group, their participants receive 1500 mg of metformin/day. All participants were requested to report the effects of treatments on diabetic manifestations, their weights, body mass index (BMI), adverse effects, fasting and post-prandial blood glucose during treatment schedule. Blood samples from participants before and after treatment were taken for serum separation, which are used for measurement of serum lipids, liver enzymes, total and direct bilirubin, albumin, and insulin.  Results: It showed a significant decrease in serum levels of triglycerides (TGs), total cholesterol (T(C)), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL(C)), liver alanine-, aspartate- and gamma glutamyl transaminase (ALT, AST, and GGT), total and direct bilirubin, fasting and post-prandial blood glucose, insulin, body weight and BMI while a significant increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL(C)) and albumin but nonsignificant change of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in PO seeds treated subjects. Metformin (M) group has the same results of PO group except in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL(C)), LDL(C), and ALP levels had a different pattern.  Conclusions: PO seeds could be effective and safe as adjuvant therapy for Type-2 diabetic subjects. These results demonstrated that PO seeds possessed notable hypoglycaemic, hypolipidaemic and insulin resistance reducer effects; possibly due to its contents of polyunsaturated fatty acids, flavonoids, and polysaccharides.

Although methyl bromide has been phased out since 2005, several crop industries, including cut flower producers, have continued methyl bromide use under Critical Use Exemptions, a provision of the Montreal Protocol. This research was conducted to evaluate newer, emerging methyl bromide alternative chemicals.  RESULTS: Two field trials were conducted to test several emerging chemicals in combination with metam sodium as replacements for methyl bromide. Emerging chemicals included 2-bromoethanol, dimethyl disulfide, furfural, propylene oxide and sodium azide. Weed and pathogen populations were measured after chemical application, and seed viability was assessed from weed seed previously buried in the plots. In the first trial, the emerging chemicals did not improve pest control compared with metam sodium alone. However, in the second trial, several of these chemicals did improve the pest control performance of metam sodium.  CONCLUSIONS: The emerging alternative chemicals have the potential to provide better control of soilborne pathogens and weeds when used with metam sodium than metam sodium alone.

Studies that combine contaminated sediments and phytoremediation are relatively recent and their number has been increasing. This work aimed to investigate whether salt marsh plants (sea club-rush Scirpus maritimus, sea rush Juncus maritimus and sea purslane Halimione portulacoides) can favor DDT and metabolites remediation in estuarine environment. For this purpose the levels of DDT, DDE and DOD were compared in vegetated and non-vegetated sediments from an estuary in the North of Portugal (in-situ study) and from another in the South of Portugal (ex-situ study). Results obtained both in the in-situ study, involving S. maritimus and J. maritimus, and in the ex-situ study, involving H. portulacoides, indicated that these plants did not have a significant role in DDTs removal and/or degradation. Therefore, it seems that the tested plants cannot influence levels and distribution of DDTs in estuarine areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Hepatic fibrosis is a common pathological process of chronic liver injury. Oxidative stress and inflammation may have prognostic value in disease progression. Objective. To examine the implication of both aforementioned factors in hepatic fibrosis progression and whether, the antioxidant effect of various biological active constituents such as phenolic, flavonoids and fatty acids of purslane hydro-ethanolic extract can represent a potential target for therapy. Methods. Purslane exhibited a considerable antioxidant potential in DPPH assay compared to a-tocopherol. Consequently, the current study was designed to examine the prophylactic and curative effects of purslane extract on bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced liver fibrosis in rats in comparison with silymarin as a reference hepatoprotective agent. Purslane (400 mg/kg/day) or silymarin (50 mg/kg/day) were administered orally for 4 weeks, immediately after surgery in order to evaluate the prophylactic effect and for 3 weeks starting 3 weeks after BDL in order to evaluate the curative effect. BDL significantly increased liver enzymes, total bilirubin (TB) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in serum along with malondialdehyde (MDA) in liver tissues. Results. Significant decrease in hepatic antioxidant defense system was noted in BDL-rats. Conversely, administration of purslane reversed all these biochemical parameters which were previously induced by BDL. Considerably, purslane effect was more pronounced in the prophylactic study than that in the curative one. Conclusion. The present work suggested that purslane had prophylactic and curative value on cholestasis-induced liver fibrosis through inhibition of oxidative stress, decreasing the expression of profibrogenic cytokines, collagenolytic activity and activation of hepatic stellate cells.

Two separate pot studies were carried out. Wheat straw was incorporated at 4, 6 and 8 g kg(-1) soil five days before the sowing of horse purslane. Pots without straw incorporation were maintained as control. In a second study, soil was taken from 15 and 30 cm depths from a previously cropped wheat field immediately after its harvest and was used as growing medium. Soil from an intentionally uncropped area of the same field was used as control. Suppressive activity was measured in terms of germination dynamics, seedling growth, and biochemical attributes such as chlorophyll contents, total soluble phenolics, soluble protein and antioxidant enzymes. Germination, seedling growth, chlorophyll contents and soluble protein of horse purslane were all negatively influenced. Higher phenolics and enhanced activities of antioxidant enzymes were noticed in response to wheat residues incorporation and its rhizosphere soil. Both studies established that the phytotoxic influence of wheat straw and wheat-infested rhizosphere soil on horse purslane can further be exploited for horse purslane management as a sustainable approach.

However, adoption is often constrained by poor weed suppression compared to nonlegume cover crops. In field experiments conducted in organic vegetable cropping systems in north-central New York, two primary hypotheses were tested: (1) mixtures of legume cover crops (cowpea and soybean) with grasses (sorghum-sudangrass and Japanese millet) reduce weed seed production and increase cover crop productivity relative to legume monocultures and (2) higher soil fertility shifts the competitive outcome in favor of weeds and nonlegume cover crops. Cover crops were grown either alone or in grass-legume combinations with or without composted chicken manure. Under hot, dry conditions in 2005, cowpea and soybean cover crops were severely suppressed by weeds in monoculture and by sorghum-sudangrass in mixtures, resulting in low legume biomass, poor nodulation, and high levels of Powell amaranth seed production (> 25,000 seeds m(-2)). Under more typical temperature and rainfall conditions in 2006, cowpea mixtures with Japanese millet stimulated cowpea biomass production and nodulation compared to monoculture, but soybeans were suppressed in mixtures with both grasses. Composted chicken manure shifted competition in favor of weeds at the expense of cowpea (2005), stimulated weed and grass biomass production (2006), and suppressed nodulation of soybean (2006). In a complementary on-farm trial, cowpea mixtures with sorghum-sudangrass suppressed weed biomass by 99%; however, both common purslane and hairy galinsoga produced sufficient seeds (600 seeds m(-2)) to replenish the existing weed seedbank. Results suggest that (1) mixtures of cowpeas with grasses can improve nodulation, lower seed costs, and reduce the risk of weed seed production; (2) soybean is not compatible with grasses in mixture; and (3) future costs of weed seed production must be considered when determining optimal cover crop choices.

The protein, fat, fiber, carbohydrate and ash contents of the selected vegetables were in the range of 2.9 to 6.6%, 0.2 to 2.5%, 2.4 to 8.6%, 9.7 to 20.1% and 1.0 to 2.3%, respectively. The concentration of vitamin C ranged between 32.6 to 120.1 mg/100 g. The phosphorus, calcium, iron, zinc, manganese, magnesium and copper were 190 to 3400, 103 to 987, 19 to 93, 12 to 47, 9 to 121, 299 to 1635 and non detectable level to 42 mg/kg, respectively. The amount of total phenolic content varied from 55.3 to 221.0 mg/g in the dry methanolic extracts of the studied plants. The EC(50) values were below 1400 mu g/ml, indicating that all the studied vegetables have good scavenging effect on DPPH radical.

Horse purslane (Trianthema portulacastrum L.) infests soybean heavily, causing enormous yield losses and threatening the sustainability of the soybean production system. Information on the interference and economic threshold of horse purslane will be useful for the effective management of horse purslane in soybean. This will lead to the rationalization of herbicide use and the reduction of herbicide input into the environment. It was observed in this study that \"a composite stand of weeds including horse purslane\", and 200 horse purslane plants per m(2) were equally competitive to soybean. These two treatments resulted in a higher dry weight, growth rate, and uptake of N, P, and K by the weeds and/or horse purslane, compared to the other treatments. They caused more reductions in soybean growth (dry weight, height, crop growth rate, net assimilation rate, and leaf area index) and resulted in a more significant yield reduction than did the other treatments. The weed density-crop yield and the relative leaf area-crop yield models were found to be equally effective in simulating soybean yield losses in relation to a wide range of horse purslane densities and the regression equations were a good fit. The quadratic equations revealed that a density of approximately six, five, and four horse purslane plants per m2 would be the economic threshold levels of horse purslane in soybean cultivation, when considering the 70, 80, and 90% horse purslane control efficiencies, respectively, of the herbicide, lactofen.

The experiment was carried out in a split plot design in which levels of salinity (0, 120 and 240 mM) were allocated as main plots and silicon application of 1 mM sodium silicate and no application assigned as subplots with three replications. The results indicated that salinity caused a reduction in root growth (volume, area, diameter, total and main length and root dry weight), and shoot biomass accumulation. Both root and leaf sodium (Na) content and leaf proline content increased with increasing salinity. Leaf and root potassium (K) content decreased with increasing salinity. Application of silicon improved root area, root dry weight, and leaf and root K content in the presence of salinity. It also caused a significant reduction in leaf Na content and consequently improved the K/Na ratio in leaves. Based on these results, P. oleracea has the capacity to grow in salt stress conditions and could be considered as a medicinal and vegetable for growth in harsh environments.

A living mulch planted between rows might limit weed seed production. Buckwheat was seeded between tomato rows after the critical period in 2007 and 2008 in field studies near Lafayette, IN. Weeds were allowed to emerge after the critical period (CP), controlled throughout the growing season (no seed threshold [NST]), or mowed to limit seed production (MOW). Buckwheat and MOW plots were mowed twice after the critical period in 2007 and once in 2008. Seed banks were sampled after the critical period and in the following spring. Tomato yields were not reduced by growing buckwheat between rows. Seed bank densities for common purslane and carpetweed, which escaped mowing due to their prostrate habits, increased in all treatments. Germinable seed bank densities were 306 seeds m(-2) or less in the NST and buckwheat treatments but 755 seeds m(-2) or more in the CP treatments for species with erect habits in both years. Seed bank densities were lower in the MOW treatment than in the CP treatments in 2007 but not in 2008. In a parallel experiment conducted in adjacent plots, buckwheat was seeded at five rates (0, 56, 112, 168, and 224 kg seed ha(-1)). Plots were mowed and emergent weeds sampled as described for the intercrop experiment. Weed densities before mowing decreased linearly with buckwheat seed rate. After mowing, no relationship was detected between seed rate and weed densities. This study supports the hypothesis that a living mulch planted after the critical period can be used to limit seed bank growth without reducing tomato yields, but additional research is needed to better understand the effect of mowing on living mulch growth and weed suppression.

Five common vegetables in South China, including lettuce (Lactuca saliva L. var. ramosa Hort.), Chinese cabbage [Brassica rapa L. subsp. Chinensis (L.) var. parachinensis (L. H. Bailey) Hanect], Chinese broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var. albiflora Kuntze), white amaranth (Amaranthus tricolor L.) and purslane (Amamnthus viridis L.), were grown in the soils and harvested after 60 d. The results showed that liming significantly reduced Cd uptake by most vegetables by 40%-50% (or a maximum of 70%), mainly due to immobilization of soil Cd. Increased availability of Ca in the soil might also contribute to the Cd uptake reduction as a result of absorption competition between Ca and Cd. Liming caused biomass reduction in white amaranth and purslane, but did not influence growth of the other vegetables. Phosphate decreased Cd uptake by vegetables by 12%-23%. Compared with lime, phosphate decreased, to a smaller extent, the bioavailability of Cd in most cases. Phosphate markedly promoted growth of vegetables. Changes in soil chemistry by adding lime or phosphate did not markedly influence nutrient uptake of vegetables except that lime increased Ca content and phosphate increased P content in shoots of the vegetables. The results suggested that a proper application of lime could be effective in reducing Cd uptake of vegetables, and phosphate could promote growth of the vegetables as well as alleviate the toxicity of Cd.

This observation prompted investigations on the biological control efficacy of MV on various Ipomoea species under a controlled environment. Seven morningglory species [ivyleaf (lpomoea hederacea), moonvine (lpomoea turbinate), palmleaf (Ipoinoea wrightii), pitted (Ipomoea lacunoso), multi-color (Ipomoea tricolor), moonflower (Ipomoea alba), and cypressvine (Ipomoea quamoclit)] were grown in greenhouse and tested at first to second leaf growth stage. MV spores (102spores mU 1) were formulated in Silwet L-77 surfactant (0.2 To, v/v) or an invert emulsion containing this surfactant. Plants were treated either with Silwet (0.2%, v/v) alone (control), invert emulsion plus Silwet, MV plus Silwet, or MV plus Silwet plus invert emulsion via spray application. After application, the plants were placed in a dew chamber (15-18 h) and then transferred to a greenhouse. Plant injury and disease progression were assessed visually and fresh and dry weights were determined at the end of tests (7 days after treatment). Some of these species exhibited more tolerance than others to spray applications of MV plus Silwet, depending on the time after treatment. Compared to MV alone treatments, formulations of MV plus the invert emulsion promoted injury symptomology in pitted and moonvine morning-glories, but caused less disease symptomology than MV alone in palmleaf seedlings. There were no significant differences in disease symptomology of the MV alone and MV plus invert treatments in the other species. Overall, the results indicate some differential injury effects of MV on closely related species, i.e., Ipomoea (morning-glories), and that the invert emulsion can increase the efficacy of MV in certain instances.

Animals were divided randomly into four groups, that is control group (C), low-dose PFP supplemented group (LP), middle-dose PFP supplemented group (MP) and high-dose PFP supplemented group (HP). Each group contains eight animals. The mice in the control group were orally administered physiological saline of 50 ml/kg bodyweight per day for 30 days, while the PFP supplemented group received the same volume of PFP of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg bodyweight. On the final day of the study, rats were exercised to exhaustion (22 m/min at 10% inclination on the treadmill) and then all the rats were sacrificed. Body weight, running time, blood lactate, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) of rats were measured. Results of the above study showed that PFP supplementation could elevate the exercise tolerance and inhibited the production of blood lactate during acute exercise. PFP supplementation lowers exercise induced oxidative stress by means of decreasing SOD, GPX activities and MDA level in skeletal muscle of young rats.

The oregano biotypes were selected on the basis of their high phenolic content. The phytotoxic potential of the oregano biotype extracts also was determined in the laboratory by using a perlite-based bioassay with cotton, corn, and barnyard grass. The bioassays indicated that the germination, root elongation, and fresh weight of cotton, corn, and barnyard grass were reduced by the oregano biotype extracts. In the field, the emergence of common purslane, barnyard grass, and bristly foxtail was reduced by 0-55%, 38-52%, and 43-86%, respectively, in the oregano green manure treatments, as compared with the oregano green manure-free treatments (the controls). At harvest, the cotton lint and corn grain yields in the oregano green manure treatments were 24-88% and 5-16%, respectively, greater than those in the corresponding green manure-free, weedy treatments. These results indicated that when the biomass of the oregano biotypes with a high phenolic content were incorporated into the soil as green manure, they could be used to suppress barnyard grass, bristly foxtail, and common purslane in cotton and corn and consequently to minimize herbicide usage.

Vacuum cooling is known as a rapid evaporative cooling technique for moist and porous products. Vacuum cooling has some advantages, such as shortened processing time, extended product shelf life, and improved product quality and safety. The aim of this paper is to apply the vacuum cooling technique to the cooling of purslane and show the pressure effect (for 0.7 kPa, 1 kPa, 1.5 kPa) on the cooling time and temperature decrease. Another purpose of this article is to compare conventional cooling (cooling by refrigerator) with vacuum cooling. It has been seen that purslane can be cooled much more rapidly and efficiently with vacuum cooling than with conventional cooling.

This is the first attempt to elucidate the possible effects of Purslane extract on muscle soreness. To examine the preventive effects of Purslane extract on delayed muscle soreness (DOMS) following one session eccentric exercise, twenty healthy non-athlete students were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. Experimental group received Purslane extract (n = 10), 1200 mg/day from 72 hours before training until 48 hours after training. One session bench-stepping exercise performed to induce DOMS. Serum LDH, CK, Cortisol, IgA, Sodium and Potassium, maximal knee extension isometric force, thigh circumference, knee range of motion, and pain perception were measured 72 hours before exercise, immediately post, 24 and 48 hours after exercise. Serum concentration of LDH and Cortisol in 24 and 48 h after exercise exhibited a significant difference between control and experimental groups (P < 0.05). Serum CK was significantly lower after 48 h (P < 0.001). IgA has shown lower concentration immediately post, 24 and 48 h after exercise (P < 0.01). The level of pain perception was significantly lower in experimental group after 48 hours (P < 0.005).

Methyl bromide (90 g m(-2)), dazomet (D) (50 g m(-2)), and metam sodium (MS) (100 mL m(-2)) were evaluated in 2 locations in the Karacasu district of Aydin province, Turkey, February-April 2005. In addition, half doses of D and MS were investigated in 2006. MeBr treatment had 52.5% control against the postemergence damping-off caused by Pythium spp.; while alternative treatments had no effect on the disease in 2005. In 2006, MeBr and MS (100 mL m(-2)) showed 77.6% and 100% control against the disease, respectively. All fumigant treatments significantly controlled pigweed species (Amaranthus spp.), common purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), nettleleaf goosefoot (Chenopodium murale L.), burning nettle (Urtica urens L.), and large crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.), except dazomet (50 g m(-2)) on pigweed (86.2%), common lambsquarters (68.6%), nettleleaf goosefoot (60.5%), and burning nettle (64.3%) at one location in 2005. Similarly, all fumigants, including low doses of MS (50 mL m(-2)) and D (25 g m(-2)), significantly decreased the populations of pigweed species, common purslane, common lambsquarters, prostrate knotweed (Polygon urn aviculare L.), and sowthistle species (Sonchus spp.) in 2006. Tobacco (cv. Akhisar) seedling height and fresh weight increased significantly with treatments of MeBr, MS (100 mL m(-2)), and D (50 g m(-2)) at the 2 locations in both years.

At the same time, low toxicant doses of metal salts have been observed to inhibit the growth of the most vigorous seedlings of a population in vitro, although mean plant size has remained unaffected. We hypothesized that this kind of selective low-dose toxicity is not restricted to inorganic contaminants. We exposed annual plants (baby's breath Gypsophila elegans, purslane Portulaca oleracea, and duckweed Lemna minor) to 1,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-4,6,6,7,8,8-hexamethylcyclopenta-gamma-2-benzopyran (HHCB) and 4-tert-octylphenol and lead acetate. As compared to unexposed G. elegans roots, 4-tert-octylphenol did not affect the mean root size of all seedlings, but it reduced the average length of roots longer than the 98(th) percentile. A comparable response was found in case of G. elegans roots treated with lead acetate beyond the 90(th) percentile. The average size of roots beyond the 90(th) percentile was decreased also when L. minor was exposed to lead acetate though the means of all roots were constant. P. oleracea seemed to be insensitive to selective toxicity. We conclude that selective toxicity at low doses should be considered in parallel with hormesis.

The aim of this research was to determine the effects of salinity, by means of exposure to different concentrations of NaCl in the nutrient solution, on the germination, growth, yield, and nitrate contents of purslane cultivated in a hydroponic system under two different light intensities. The results indicated that higher germination percentages (approx. 50%) were obtained between saline levels with electrical conductivities (EC) of 0 - 12.5 dS m(-1). Above 12.5 dS m(-1) the germination percentage decreased significantly. Salinity reduced both shoot and root growth. This reduction was greater in plants grown under the lower light intensity. When the EC of the nutrient solution increased from 2.5 dS m(-1) to 15.0 dS m(-1), yields were reduced by 26% in plants grown in a greenhouse, and by 82.2% in plants grown under the lower light intensity in a growth chamber. In both cases, nitrate levels increased in plants grown at an EC of 5.0 dS m(-1), but nitrate levels decreased with further increases in salinity. In all cases, nitrate levels were below the maximum levels established by European Regulations for lettuce. ", "Writer": "  By:Franco, JA (Franco, J.

The floating system is a way to grow this crop, at high density from sowing to harvest and easy to use in relation substrate culture, and it is well known water culture can be limited by hypoxia. Few studies have examined the use of peroxides or peracetic acid in nutrient solutions as a source of oxygenation. The aim of the study was to evaluate the rocket grown in substrates as compared to the floating system with a stabilized mixture of peracetic acid in the nutrient solution. The experiment was carried out in and Talca (Chile) from October to November 2008. The treatments were substrate culture perlite and composted pine bark (1:1); floating system with trays filled with the same substrate and 0, 90 and 80 mg.L-1 of stabilized peracetic acid mix (PA). The fresh and dry weight of rocket leaves at harvest we evaluated. We recorded total nutrient solution uptake; the average dissolved oxygen; pH and electrical conductivity (EC). A randomized complete block design with four replicates was conducted using Tukey's multiple range test (P < 0.05). The results suggest from 40 to 80 mg.L-1 PA applied to the nutrient solution, increases the fresh and dry weight in the rocket crop grown by floating system and may compensate this limiting factor in the growth, if it was compared with higher oxygen available substrate culture.

Total lipids content ranged from 3.31 +/- 0.19 to 17.78 +/- 0.27 mg/g (fresh weight). The three most abundant fatty acids were C16:0, C18:2 omega 6 and C18:3 omega 3. Unsaturated fatty acids predominated in all the Artemisia species are studied with the alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and linoleic acid (LA), which are essential for normal human growth, health promotion, and disease prevention. The predominant omega 3 PUFA acid in all Artemisia species analyzed, was linolenic acid, with Artemisia gmellini, Artemisia ludoviciana and Artemisia vulgaris, showing higher amounts of this fatty acid, all thirteen species, analyzed in this study, were also rich in oleic acid (omega 9) and linoleic acid (omega 6), accounted for 50-70% of total PUFA. The ratio of omega 3 PUFA to omega 6 PUFA was similar in all species, varying from 1.0 to 3.0. Identifying Artemisia species as newer sources of PUFAs and enriching or optimizing the omega 3FAs in known plant sources offer us ways of increasing the availability of omega 3FAs in the food supply.

In this paper, five simple methods were used to predict the optimum harvest date of baby leaf purslane based on daily maximum and minimum air temperatures. The methods were chosen based on their performance as described in the literature for several vegetable crops. The most reliable method was defined as the one with the smallest coefficient of variation (CV). The CV's were calculated for each method over two seasons and two years. All heat unit methods had smaller CV and improved harvest date prediction accuracy than the standard method of counting days from sowing to harvest. Autumn cycles were the largest (approximately two months), while the summer cycles were the shortest, being the purslane harvested in just 13 days. The base temperature varied among seasons, being higher (6 degrees C) for summer cycles than for autumn cycles (0 degrees C). The best fits were obtained with the combination of a Tb of 0 degrees C with a Ceiling of 34 degrees C for summer and 28 degrees C for autumn. Incorporating radiation improved the model prediction accuracy. Based on these results, the heat unit summation method recommended for this region is the reduced ceiling method considering radiation.

An experimental orchard was established on two different rootstocks, (Poncirus trifoliata L.) Raf. and Troyer citrange (Poncirus trifoliata x Citrus sinensis)) and the orchard was irrigated at 2 different salinity levels (0.65 and 5 dSm(-1). The ground of the on rows of Satsuma mandarin trees was kept either with its natural flora (vegetation) or with cultivated purslane. Results are statistically examined with respect to the effects and interactions between the tested factors; rootstock, salinity and remediation tools. Biomass yields of the tested alternatives (natural vegetation and purslane) and their Na, Cl, K and Ca concentrations were measured. Also Na and Cl concentrations of mandarin leaves were analyzed to examine the remediation effect. Results showed that yield depressions of the natural vegetation plots were higher compared to purslane and showed a considerable difference according to the rootstock. Sodium removal of purslane and natural vegetation was found to be similar. Chloride uptake was lower in Troyer citrange compared to P. trifoliata. Purslane and/or natural vegetation can equally be recommended as Na removing bioremediation crops. Purslane can also be recommended as a promising Cl remover suitable for orchards on P. trifoliata (L.) Raf. rootstock.

In a first trial, fresh leaves were harvested and stored under different temperatures (0, 5, and 10 degrees C) for 17 days. Storage temperature significantly affected color, visual quality, respiration rate, ethylene production, weight loss, vitamin C content, antioxidant activity, total phenolic and total and soluble oxalic acid contents. Leaves stored at 10 degrees C did not withstand the entire storage period, being judged not marketable after 8 days, while leaves stored at 0 and 5 degrees C were still marketable after 13 and 10 days, respectively. Samples stored at 10 degrees C showed a lower hue angle value and a higher chlorophyll loss compared to other samples, while no symptom of chilling injury was observed in leaves stored at 0 and 5 degrees C. Respiration rate significantly increased with increasing storage temperature: ethylene production was also affected by storage temperature, although values were very low (<1 nLC(2)H(4)/kg/h at 10 degrees C). Vitamin C was more sensitive to postharvest deterioration during storage and a marked reduction was observed in samples stored at 10 degrees C. In addition, purslane was found to be high in antioxidants (192 mg TEAC/100g fw, at harvest) and total phenols (471 mg GAE/100 g fw) and the decline observed during storage was influenced by temperature. A second trial was performed in order to evaluate the effect of exogenous ethylene on leaves during storage at two temperatures. Fresh leaves were harvested and exposed to air (as control), and to 0.1, 1, and 10 mu L/L of ethylene for 15 days at 0 and 15 degrees C. Exposure to C(2)H(4) affected respiration rate, color and overall appearance but only at 15 degrees C and for high ethylene concentrations (1 and 10 mu L/L). Leaves did not withstand the entire storage period and marketable life was about 7 days at 15 degrees C, except for leaves exposed to 10 mu L/L of C(2)H(4), while for all samples held at 0 degrees C marketable life exceeded 10 days. Loss of marketability was due to yellowing and discoloration. It is concluded that purslane is not chilling sensitive, can be stored successfully at low temperatures, produces very small amounts of ethylene and is not sensitive to a low concentration of ethylene, especially when exposure occurs at low temperature.

Knowing the effects of nitrate and ammonium on oxalate accumulation, we tested the agronomic potential of three members of the P. oleracea aggregate under various nitrogen fertilization conditions, by measuring biomass production and accumulation of fatty acids, organic acids and tocopherol in the commercial P. sativa (Pos) and two natural members: P. nitida (Pon) and P. papillato-stellulata (Pop).  RESULTS: With nitrate as the sole N source, we measured differences between Pon and Pos in concentrations of the essential omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid. Pos also gained less dry biomass under these conditions, implying a higher agronomical and nutritional value for Pon. Increasing the fertilizer ammonium concentration and reducing that of nitrate significantly decreased oxalic acid by factors of up to 1.7, 2.6 and 3.4 in Pos, Pop and Pon, respectively, significantly increased concentrations of tocopherol and malic acid, had no effect on fatty acids or ascorbic acid, but reduced biomass.  CONCLUSION: In spite of the recumbent growth habit of Pon, the present findings indicate its agronomic potential. Because early flowering and seed production may be the limiting factors in purslane agriculture, growing Pon in nitrate-poor conditions might be agriculturally favorable.

By increasing the microwave output power (180-900W) and the sample amounts (25-100 g), the drying time decreased from 43 to 12.5 minutes and increased from 27 to 54 minutes, respectively. To determine the kinetic parameters, the drying data were fitted to various models based on the ratios of the differences between the initial and final moisture contents and equilibrium moisture content versus drying time. Among the models proposed, the semi-empirical Midilli et al. model gave a better fit for all drying conditions applied. By increasing the microwave output power and decreasing the sample amount, the effective moisture diffusivity values ranged from 5.913x10(-11) to 1.872x10(-10) m(2)/s and from 9.889x10(-11) to 3.292x10(-11) m(2)/s, respectively.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty 80-week-old layers were allocated randomly to receive diets supplemented with 0 (control), 10 g kg(-1) or 20 g kg(-1) dried purslane for 84 days. Egg weights and egg production in the groups were recorded daily, whereas feed intake was measured weekly.  RESULTS: Diet supplemented with 20 g kg(-1) purslane significantly decreased body weight of the chickens compared to the control. Inclusion of purslane at the level of 10 g kg(-1) or 209 kg(-1) into the diet significantly (P < 0.05) improved egg weight compared to the control. Chickens fed the diet including 209 kg(-1) purslane had a significantly (P < 0.05) higher egg production and improved feed efficiency compared to the control. Cholesterol content of eggs from the hens fed 0, 10 or 209 kg(-1) did not differ and was 10.45, 9.51 or 9.51 mg g(-1) dried egg yolk, respectively. Inclusion of purslane at the level of 20 g kg(-1) into the diet significantly (P < 0.05) increased omega-3 fatty acids such as C18 : 3(omega-3) and C22 :6(omega-3). The ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 also was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the eggs from chickens fed 10 g kg(-1) or 20 g kg(-1) purslane supplemented diets compared to the control.  CONCLUSION: This study showed that adding dried purslane to the diet of laying hens significantly increased egg production and egg weights although there was no reduction in the egg cholesterol concentration. This study also showed that inclusion of purslane into diet enriched eggs with omega-3 fatty acids and decreased the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 in the yolk.

In the laboratory bioassay, sorghum+sunflower water extract combination at higher concentration (100%) completely inhibited germination of horse purslane. In pot experiment, the foliar application of sorghum + sunflower water extract combination at higher concentration (100%) greatly suppressed growth traits (shoot & root length) of horse purslane seedling and this combination reduced shoot dry weight by 66% over control. Inhibitory effect was proportional to the concentrations of the extracts and higher concentration had the stronger inhibitory effect.

In this study, we aimed to determine the microchemical components of purslane stem, leaf, and flower, including the phenolic acid, flavonoid, ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, and fatty acid content. The water extract of the flower fraction contained the highest total phenolic acid content and had the highest O(2)-scavenging activities, whereas leaf contained the highest amount of total flavonoids and ascorbic acid. The beta-carotene content was not significantly different in leaf and flower fractions but was significantly greater than that in stem (P < 0.05). The predominant phenolic acid was chlorogenic acid for all fractions. Rutin was the major flavonoid found in leaf, and myricetin was highest in flower and stem. Alpha linolenic acid (18:3n-3) content ranged from 16% (149 mg per 100-g sample) of total fatty acid in stem to 50% (523 mg per 100-g sample) in leaf.

The aim was to evaluate weed control with several biodegradable mulches as alternatives to black polyethylene (PE) mulch. The treatments were rice straw, barley straw, maize harvest residue, absinth wormwood plants, black biodegradable plastic, brown kraft paper, PE, herbicide, manual weeding, and unweeded control. Assessments focused on weeds and on crop yield. A laboratory study showed that 1 kg/m(2) of organic mulch was sufficient to cover the soil for rice, barley straw, and maize harvest residue. The most abundant weed species in the field were purple nutsedge, common purslane, common lambsquarters, and large crabgrass and a change in weed composition was observed between treatments and years. Most weed species were controlled by the mulching materials except that purple nutsedge was controlled only by paper mulch. The other species were well controlled by PE and biodegradable plastic and also by some of the organic mulch treatments. Best weed control and lowest weed biomass were achieved by paper followed by PE and biodegradable plastic. The best organic mulch was rice straw and the worst weed control was from absinth wormwood.

This plant is also of interest because of its high biomass production and its potential to produce ethanol for biofuel. Allelopathy may be an advantageous trait in Jerusalem artichoke under cultivation, as it potentially reduces weed interference with the crop, theoretically allowing a reduction of mechanical or chemical input required for weed management. However, this trait may also be unfavorable if other crops are cultivated in rotation with Jerusalem artichoke or in areas infested by this species. The aim of this study was to investigate the sensitivity of selected diverse crops (wheat, lettuce, corn, tomato, rice, and zucchini) and weeds (barnyardgrass, black nightshade, common lambsquarters, common purslane, large crabgrass, and pigweed) to the presence of Jerusalem artichoke dried leaf tissues in laboratory experiments performed under controlled conditions. The simulated soil incorporation of different Jerusalem artichoke residues (four cultivars and a weedy population) was carried out in a series of laboratory and greenhouse experiments. Jerusalem artichoke reduced the radicle growth of seedling lettuce (60%), tomato (30%), large crabgrass (70%), and barnyardgrass (30%), whereas total germination of these species was less affected. Sensitivity to Jerusalem artichoke residues was species dependent; germination and initial growth of corn were not affected, whereas winter wheat, lettuce, tomato, rice, and zucchini seedlings were more sensitive to residue presence. Our experiments show that both wild and cultivated decomposing Jerusalem artichoke residues, particularly leaves and stems, possess phytotoxic potential. Additional field experimentation remains to be conducted to determine if allelopathy in the field contributes to its invasibility.

In the first study, we examined rates of visitation by adults to Heliotropium curassavicum (Boraginaceae) inflorescences and Sesuvium verrucosum (Aizoaceae) flowers on potted plants. Visitation rates per plant or per inflorescence or flower did not differ between species when species were placed alone or together or when plants were placed in sun or shade. Frequencies of landings on both species were greater on plants in sun than shade, suggesting sooty-wings visually respond to flowers when foraging for nectar. In the second study, we measured masses of sugar in H. curassavicum inflorescences on wild plants after visitation by male or female adults. Inflorescences visited by females contained more sugar, but similar numbers of flowers, than those visited by males. Amounts of sugar remaining in inflorescences visited by females, but not males, decreased as visitation-times increased. Ingestion of nectar was apparent only in females. Both plant species can provide H. gracielae adults with nectar in conserved or created habitat.

This study was conducted to investigate the possibilities of reducing pendimethalin dosage by tank mixing with allelopathic crop water extracts for weed control in canola (Brassica napus L.). Allelopathic crop water extracts including sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), mustard (Brassica campestris L.) and rice (Olyza saliva L.) each at 15 L ha(-1) were tank mixed with 0.4 and 0.6 kg active ingredient (a.i.) ha(-1) pendimethalin and sprayed immediately after sowing. Control (weedy check) and standard dose of pendimethalin 1.2 kg (a.i.) ha(-1) were used for comparison. Data regarding weed density, weed fresh weight, weed dry weight and yield components was recorded. Horse purslane (Trianthema portulacastrum L.), purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundas L.), lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and swine cress (Cronopus didymus L.) were the weeds present in the experimental field. Weed density, weed fresh weight and dry weight were lower than control in all the treatments; however the performance of various combinations of allelopathic crop water extracts and lower pendimathalin rates was better than the standard dose of herbicide particularly in case of purple nutsedge (C. rotundas L.). All the yield contributing parameters including number of branches per plant, number of pods per plant, numbers of seeds per pod and 1000-seed weight were higher, where combinations of allelopathic extracts were used with lower herbicide rates. In crux, pendimethalin dose for successful weed control in canola can be reduced up to 67% for environmental safety.

A total of 164 samples comprising of different leafy green vegetables (8 basils, 15 dills, 20 garden cresses, 16 kales, 12 lettuces, 19 mints, 19 parsleys, 18 purslanes, 1 radish, 20 rockets, 14 scallions and 2 spinaches) were randomly collected from nearby agricultural fields in the close vicinity of Ankara Stream over an 8-month period between April 2007 and November 2007. Samples were examined for Salmonella and L. monocytogenes using ISO methods with immunomagnetic separation (IMS) and then polymerase chain reaction (PCR). No Salmonella and L. monocytogenes was detected from the 25-g radish, spinach and scallion samples tested. However, 23 samples (1 basil, 2 dills, 1 garden cress, 1 kale, 2 lettuces, 4 mints, 3 parsleys, 5 purslanes and 4 rockets) were positive for Salmonella and 14 samples (3 basils, 1 dill, 1 garden cress, 2 kales, 1 lettuce, 1 mint, 2 parsleys, 1 purslane and 2 rockets) were positive for L. monocytogenes. Overall, important contamination of leafy green vegetables by Salmonella and L. monocytogenes was observed. Therefore, this study will draw attention to the production of freshly consumed leafy green vegetables and so will aid in the development of control measures for these pathogens before harvesting and will highlight the importance of their intake which may cause a communicable disease and so pose a serious threat to both environment and human health.

All the explants were cultured on MS basal medium supplemented with 30 g/l sucrose, 8 g/l agar and different plant growth regulators. Nodal segments of Mose Rose were cultured on media containing different levels of BAP or kinetin (0, 5 and 10 mu M) to direct shoot regeneration study. Leaf explants were cultured in different combination of BAP (at three levels: 2.5, 5 and 10 mu M) and NAA (at two levels: 5 and 10 mu M) to examine callus formation. After the callus formation the formed calli were cultured on different combinations of BAP and NAA for shoot regeneration. BAP at three levels (5 and 10 and 15 mu M) and NAA at two levels (5 and 10 mu M) in all possible combinations (totally 6 hormonal treatments) were used for shoot regeneration from callus. The results showed that the treatment containing 10 mu M BAP was found to be the best one for shoot regeneration from nodal segments. The treatment with 10 mu M NAA in combination with 10 or 5 mu M BAP were found to be suitable treatments for callus production from leaf explants, as well.

A total of 37 biopsy-proven symptomatic OLP patients were selected for this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. All subjects were divided into two groups to receive purslane (n = 20) or placebo (n = 17) for 3 months. Assessments were made at baseline, after 2 weeks and each month for 6 months, based on the visual analog scale (VAS) and clinical improvement including lesion type and size. Approximately 83% of the purslane patients showed partial to complete clinical improvement but 17% had no response. In the placebo group 17% experienced partial improvement, 73% did not respond and 10% showed worsening. According to VAS scores, a partial to complete response was observed in all purslane-treated patients, while 71%, 15% and 14% of the controls demonstrated partial response, no response and worsening of the symptoms, respectively. A significant decrease in VAS scores was seen at the end of the study period (p < 0.001). No serious side-effects occurred in either of the groups. According to our findings purslane is clinically effective in the treatment of OLP. Considering the lack of side-effects during the study period, it may be a favorable alternative treatment for OLP.

In laboratory bioassays, the mixture (100%) of sorghum + sunflower + brassica + mulberry aqueous extracts completely inhibited the germination and seedling growth of T portulacastrum. In pot culture, two foliar sprays of sorghum + sunflower + brassica + mulberry water extracts inhibited its growth (leaf area, root and shoot length) and drastically reduced the dry matter production (96%).

In pot culture, four rye (Secale cereale L.) cultivars (Fasto, Forestier, Nikita, Primizia) were grown in open with two nitrogen rates (0 and 50 kg N ha(-1)) to determine their weed suppressiveness on three warm-season weeds (Chenopodium album L., Amaranthus retroflexus L., and Portulaca oleracea L.) in greenhouse. The contents of benzoxazinoids, DIBOA and DIBOA-Glucose were determined in rye cultivars tissues. Total benzoxazinoid content ranged from 80 to 450 mu g g(-1) d.m. and differed between the cultivars. Nitrogen application increased the benzoxazinoid content, 50 kg N ha(-1) produced more benzoxazinoid content than 0 kg N ha(-1) (258 vs. 154 mu g g(-1), i.e. +41% higher). The rye mulch obtained from different cultivars and from two N fertilisation levels (0 and 50 kg N ha(-1)) inhibited the growth of test weed spp. There was no correlation between the total benzoxazinoid content and the number of weed seedlings suppressed. The field study determined the allelopathic effects of rye cover crop on weeds (grass and broadleaf) in maize grown with two tillage systems (no-tillage, conventional tillage) at three nitrogen rates (0, 250, 300 kg N ha(-1)). The mulching significantly reduced the density of grass and broadleaf weeds by 61% and 96%, respectively. In no-tillage, residual nitrogen drastically reduced the broadleaf weeds density (83-90%), but the conventional tillage, increased their population (61-65%). Linear regressions between DIBOA and DIBOA-Glucose in the mulch and weed inhibition (%) were statistically significant, with R(2) of 0.59 and R(2) of 0.65 for grass and broadleaf weeds, respectively.

The experiments were laid out in Randomized Complete Block (RCB) design with split plot arrangements having three replications. Four maize plant spacings (15, 20, 25 and 30 cm) were kept in main plots, while weed densities (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 m(-2)) were allotted to sub plots. Narrow plant spacing of 15 cm produced higher grain yield of 2.85 and 2.66 t ha(-1) as compared to 2.30 and 2.08 t ha(-1) in wider plant spacing of 30 cm during 2006 and 2007, respectively. However, during both years, yield components of individual plants were negatively affected with a decrease in plant spacing. Similarly, control plots produced higher grain yield of 3.04 and 2.87 t ha(-1) as compared to grain yield of 2.14 and 2.0 t ha(-1) in plots having weed density of 18 plants m(-2) in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Losses due to T. portulacastrum were 4.2, 11.1, 18.6, 20.4, 27.2 and 29.5% during 2006 and 9.3, 14.3, 18.3, 23.2, 25.1 and 30.2% during 2007 in plots having 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 weeds m(-2). Two years research showed that narrow spacing enhanced competitive ability of maize crop and suppressed weed growth, which eventually resulted in higher yield, depicting that T. portulacastrum is a strong competitor of maize and may cause substantial yield losses depending on plant spacing and weed density. Moreover, plant spacing alone is not effective to suppress T. portulacastrum; therefore, other cultural practices should also be integrated with narrow spacing to reduce yield losses in maize crop.

The innovative cultivation system under floating trays allows obtaining clean, safe and high quality raw material for the minimal processing or fresh-cut vegetables industry. In addition, it is relatively cheap and easy to implement at commercial level, being an efficient system to produce leafy vegetables. There are very scarce studies about the postharvest quality changes of minimally processed baby leaves grown under this cultivation system. The aim of this work was to study the sensory and microbial quality and total antioxidant capacity changes during shelf life of purslane grown in floating trays system with two aeration levels. After manual harvest, the raw material was pre-washed with tap water at 5 degrees C, and subsequently it was washed for 2 min and disinfected by immersion in a solution at 5 degrees C with 100 ppm NaClO at pH 6.5. As control, a 2 min tap water washing at 5 degrees C was done. Then, the purslane was spin dried to eliminate water excess. The final product was packed under passive modified atmosphere packaging in polypropylene baskets, top sealed with a bi-oriented polypropylene and stored up to 10 days at 5 degrees C. The steady state atmosphere within all baskets was 11-13 kPa O-2 and 8-10 kPa CO2 which was reached after 7 days. The total antioxidant capacity decreased up to 10-20% in all treatments regarding the initial values (11-13 mg ascorbic acid eq.kg(-1) fw). The initial mesophilic counts were 2-3 log cfu.g(-1), and after 10 days at 5 degrees C it remained below the legal limits for safe consumption, without differences among treatments. The sensory quality parameters changes determined a shelf life of 10 days at 5 degrees C. As main conclusion, floating trays were a good system for cultivation of purslane as raw material for the minimal processing industry due to the low initial microbial load, which can avoid or reduce the use of chemical disinfectants and will preserve the overall quality.

Recently, there is an increasing interest in purslane due to its Omega-3 fatty acid and antioxidants contents. In Turkey, purslane is harvested by pulling from the soil, washed and marketed in bunches with its roots, at ambient temperatures. Marketing with roots brings different sanitation problems. Besides, marketing without any refrigeration causes losses in quality, alongside nutrients. In this study, the changes in visual quality, total lipid content and antioxidant power at default marketing conditions was examined. Both visual and nutritional quality was better preserved at 5 degrees C and in clam-shell containers. Widely used marketing conditions, i.e., bunches at 20 degrees C, caused significant product, quality, total lipid and antioxidant losses. "}

The results revealed that in a dose-dependent manner, Purslane polysaccharides could significantly scavenge superoxide anion, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH(-)), nitric oxide and hydroxyl radicals. Furthermore, the Purslane polysaccharides could still effectively inhibit the red blood cell (RBC) haemodialysis, and increase spleen, thymocyte T and B lymphocyte proliferation, it could be concluded that Purslane polysaccharides could be of considerable preventive and therapeutic significance to some free radical associated health problems such as ovarian cancer, by scavenging accumulating free radicals and enhancing immunity functions.

All the explants were cultured on MS basal medium supplement with 30 g/l sucrose, 8 g/l agar and different plant growth regulator. Petioles, shoot tips and leaves of wild purslane and also leaves of agronomic purslane were cultured in different concentrations and combinations of IBA and BAP (Both in the same four levels, 0, 1, 5 and 10 mu M; collectively 16 treatments). On the other hand, nodal segments and shoot tips of agronomic purslane were cultured in different concentrations (4.44, 8.88 and 13.32 mu M) of BAP or kinetin. The regenerated were rooted in the media containing three levels of IBA or IBA (0.0, 2.5 and 5 mu M). Results showed that the treatments containing 10 mu M IBA in combination with 10 or 5 mu M BAP are suitable for callus induction from leaves of wild purslane. Direct shoot regeneration from shoot tips or petiole explants of wild purslane was observed only in 10 mu M IBA alone. Also, BAP at level 8.88 mu M was found to be the best treatment to shoot regeneration from nodal segments of agronomic purslane and IBA at level 2.5 mu M was found to be the best treatment for rooting of regenerated shoots in both races of purslane.

Portulaca oleracea L., commonly named purslane, is used in Iranian folk medicine to treat AUB. To verify this use, ten premenopausal women with AUB comprising menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, polymenorrhea and intermenstrual bleeding who had not responded to standard drugs and were candidates for hysterectomy participated in the clinical trial. Endometrial biopsies demonstrated the etiologies of AUB in six (60%) patients, fibroma; one (10%) patient, endometrial hyperplasia and one (10%) patient, endometrial cyst. Endometrial biopsies of two (20%) subjects were normal. The subjects took 5 g of purslane seeds powder in a glass of water every 4 It orally 48 h after the onset of menstruation for 3 days. The participants were requested to report the effects of seeds powder on the volume, duration and pattern of bleeding. Eight (80%) patients reported that the duration and volume of bleeding had reduced and their patterns of periods had normalized. The seeds powder was ineffective in two (20%) patients. One of the patients had endometrial hyperplasia and the other had fibroma. No adverse effects were reported. AUB did not recur in the patients responding to treatment for the duration of a 3 months follow-tip. The results suggest that purslane seeds could be effective and safe in the treatment of AUB.

We conducted several experiments in commercial lettuce fields in the Salinas Valley, CA, to evaluate the effects of mustard cover crops on lettuce drop caused by Sclerotinia minor and on weed density and seed viability. In a long-term study, we measured the effects of white and Indian mustard cover crops on the density of S. minor sclerotia in soil, lettuce drop incidence, weed densities, weed seed viability, and crop yield in head lettuce. We also tested broccoli and rye cover crop treatments and a fallow control. Across several short-term studies, we evaluated the density of S. minor sclerotia in soil, lettuce drop incidence, weed densities, and weed seed viability following cover cropping with a mustard species blend. Numbers of sclerotia in soil were low in most experimental locations and were not affected by cover cropping. Mustard cover crops did not reduce disease incidence in the long-term experiment but the incidence of lettuce drop was lower in mustard-cover-cropped plots across the short-term experiments. With the exception of common purslane and hairy nightshade, weed densities and weed seed viability were not significantly reduced by cover cropping with mustard. Head lettuce yield was significantly higher in mustard-cover-cropped plots compared with a fallow control. Glucosinolate content in the two mustard species was similar to those measured in other studies but, when converted to an equivalent of a commercial fumigant, the concentrations were much lower than the labeled rate for lettuce production. Although mustard cover cropping resulted in yield benefits in this study, there was little to no disease or weed suppression.
